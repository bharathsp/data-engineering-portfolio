# 🔹 What is **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**?

**Delta Live Tables (DLT)** is a **framework in Databricks** for building **reliable, production-grade data pipelines**.
It’s designed to simplify **data engineering**, automate infrastructure management, and ensure **data quality and consistency**.

In short: **DLT = “create your data pipeline declaratively, and Databricks manages the rest.”**

---

## 🔹 Key Concepts

### 1. **Declarative Pipelines** 📑

* You define **what** the pipeline should do, not **how** to manage compute or scheduling.
* Example:

  ```python
  @dlt.table
  def clean_sales_data():
      return spark.read("raw_sales").filter("amount > 0")
  ```
* ✅ Databricks handles scaling, retries, and pipeline execution.

---

### 2. **Supports Batch + Streaming** ⏱️

* One API can handle **batch data** (daily files) or **streaming data** (Kafka, Event Hubs).
* Automatically manages continuous ingestion and transformations.

---

### 3. **Built-in Data Quality** ✅

* DLT allows **expectations** to define data quality rules:

  * Example: `@dlt.expect("valid_amount", "amount >= 0")`
* Automatically logs and manages **records that fail expectations**.

---

### 4. **Automatic Infrastructure Management** ⚙️

* No need to manually configure clusters.
* DLT:

  * Creates and scales clusters as needed
  * Monitors progress and retries failed tasks
  * Optimizes resources

---

### 5. **Integration with Lakehouse** 🏞️

* Works directly on **Delta Lake tables**.
* Ensures **ACID transactions, schema evolution, and reliability**.
* Output tables are immediately **queryable for BI, SQL, or ML workflows**.

---

### 6. **Orchestration & Lineage** 🔄

* Visual representation of **pipeline flow** in Databricks Studio.
* Tracks **data lineage** automatically → easier debugging and auditing.

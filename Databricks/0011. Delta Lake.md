# 🔹 What is **Delta Lake**?

**Delta Lake** is an **open-source storage layer** that brings **reliability, performance, and governance** to data lakes.

It sits **on top of a data lake** (like AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, or GCS) and **turns a raw data lake into a trusted Lakehouse**.

Think of it as:

> “A Delta Lake = a **data lake + data warehouse features**”

## 🔹 Key Features of Delta Lake

### 1. **ACID Transactions** ✅

* Delta Lake provides **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability**.
* Guarantees **data correctness** even with concurrent reads and writes.
* Example: Multiple pipelines writing to the same table won’t corrupt data.

---

### 2. **Schema Enforcement & Evolution** 📑

* **Enforces schema** to prevent bad data from entering tables.
* **Schema evolution** allows tables to adapt to changing data structures automatically.

---

### 3. **Time Travel** ⏳

* Delta Lake keeps **historical versions** of your data.
* You can query **past snapshots** for:

  * Auditing
  * Debugging
  * Reverting mistakes
* Example SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales DELTA AS OF '2025-09-27'
```

---

### 4. **Upserts and Deletes (MERGE)** 🔄

* Supports **insert, update, delete, merge** operations.
* Ideal for **slowly changing dimensions (SCDs)** and CDC (Change Data Capture).

---

### 5. **Scalable & High Performance** ⚡

* Uses **Parquet** format + **indexes & data skipping** → fast queries.
* Supports **Z-ordering** for optimized storage layout.
* Integrates with **Databricks Photon engine** for high-speed SQL queries.

---

### 6. **Open & Interoperable** 🔗

* Built on **open-source formats** (Parquet, Delta transaction log).
* Compatible with **Spark, Python, SQL, BI tools, and other engines**.

# 🔹 What is Model Serving in Databricks?

**Model Serving** allows you to **deploy machine learning models as real-time REST endpoints**, making it easy to integrate predictions into **dashboards, applications, and automated workflows**.

It is tightly integrated with **MLflow**, Databricks’ machine learning lifecycle platform.

---

## 🔹 Key Features

### 1. **Seamless Integration with MLflow Model Registry** 📦

* Models registered in **MLflow Model Registry** can be **deployed directly for serving**.
* Supports **versioning**: deploy specific versions or promote staging models to production.
* Enables **reproducibility and governance** of models.

**Benefit:**

* Reduces friction in moving models from **training → testing → deployment**.

---

### 2. **REST Endpoint Integration** 🌐

* Every served model gets a **REST API endpoint**.
* External applications, dashboards, or BI tools can **call the model in real time**.
* Works with **Python, Java, R, or any HTTP client**.

**Example:**

```http
POST /model/sales_forecast/1/invocations
Content-Type: application/json

{"data": [[2025, "product_A", 100]]}
```

**Benefit:**

* Makes ML predictions accessible **without complex integration code**.

---

### 3. **Low Latency & High Throughput** ⚡

* Optimized for **real-time inference**: milliseconds response times.
* Can handle **large volumes of requests per second**.
* Supports **auto-scaling** of resources to meet traffic demands.

**Benefit:**

* Enables **real-time personalization, fraud detection, recommendation engines**, or any low-latency ML application.

# 🔹 What is **Delta Sharing**?

**Delta Sharing** is an **open, cross-platform protocol for secure data sharing**.

* Allows sharing of **Delta, Parquet, or Iceberg tables** across organizations or platforms.
* **Live sharing** — no need to copy data. The shared data remains **on the provider’s data lake**, ensuring it is **up-to-date and reliable in real time**.
* Avoids **vendor lock-in** — works across Databricks, Snowflake, Power BI, Tableau, Python, R, and more.
* Not limited to tables — can also share:

  * Notebooks
  * ML models
  * Dashboards

**Key idea:** “Share **live, governed, and reliable data** across organizations without moving or duplicating it.”

# 🔹 How Workspace & Notebook Fit Together

```
Databricks Workspace 🏢
    ├─ Folders 📁 → Organize assets
    ├─ Notebooks 📓 → Write & execute code
    ├─ Dashboards 📊 → Visualize outputs
    ├─ Jobs ⏱ → Schedule pipelines
    ├─ MLflow 🤖 → Track ML experiments
    └─ Delta Live Tables 🔄 → Build pipelines

Workspace provides the environment → Notebooks are where the work happens.
```

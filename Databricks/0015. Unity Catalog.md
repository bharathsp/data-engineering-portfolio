# 🔹 What is **Unity Catalog**?

**Unity Catalog** is Databricks’ **centralized governance, metadata, and access control system** for all data and AI assets.

It’s designed to provide:

* **Data governance** (who can access what)
* **Data discovery** (find the right datasets easily)
* **Compliance & lineage tracking** (audit and track changes)

Think of it as:

> “Unity Catalog = the **brain of the Lakehouse**, keeping track of **data, metadata, security, and access policies** across the organization.”

* Provides **a single source of truth** for all datasets.
* Makes it easy to **search and discover data** across workspaces.

---

### 2. **Fine-Grained Access Control** 🔑

* Controls **who can access what** at multiple levels:

  * Table-level
  * Column-level
  * Row-level
* Supports **role-based access control (RBAC)** for enterprise governance.

---

### 3. **Data Lineage Tracking** 🔄

* Tracks the **flow of data from source to output**.
* Useful for:

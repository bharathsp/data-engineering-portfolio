**1.** A company uses a pre-trained AI model and further trains it with their own question-answer dataset. Which term is used to define this process?

* A. Prompt Engineering
* B. Content Generation
* C. Fine-tuning
* D. Sentiment Analysis

```
C. Fine-tuning

Why:
Fine-tuning means taking a pre-trained AI model and training it further with your own dataset to specialize it for a specific task (e.g., question-answering). The other options don’t involve retraining.
```

**2.** In Large Language Models (LLMs), the input text is divided into pieces and converted into numeric values. What is the term used to describe each of these input chunks?

* A. Embedding Function
* B. Decoding
* C. Token
* D. Transformer

```
C. Token

Why:
Each chunk of input text in LLMs is called a token. Tokens are the units that get converted into numbers for processing. Embeddings convert tokens into vectors, decoding turns numbers back to text, and transformer is the architecture.
```

**3.** Databricks Lakehouse AI provides one unified toolkit for building and serving AI models. Which statements correctly describe its capabilities? (Choose 2)

* A. Unity Catalog offers governance and lineage for data and AI resources.
* B. Lakehouse Monitoring enables the tracking of AI model logs, ensuring continuous improvement and optimization.
* C. AI model development supports open-source models only.
* D. MLflow AI Gateway enables comparing multiple models against each other and observing responses.

```
A. Unity Catalog offers governance and lineage for data and AI resources.  
B. Lakehouse Monitoring enables the tracking of AI model logs, ensuring continuous improvement and optimization.  

Why:
These are correct. AI model development supports both open-source and proprietary models, and MLflow AI Gateway is for safe access to models, not comparison.
```

**4.** Which two Large Language Models (LLMs) are open-source and can be used for commercial purposes? (Choose 2)

* A. Databricks’ Dolly
* B. OpenAI’s ChatGPT
* C. MosaicML’s MPT
* D. Meta’s LLaMA (v1)

```
A. Databricks’ Dolly  
C. MosaicML’s MPT  

Why:
Both Dolly and MPT are open-source and allow commercial use. ChatGPT is proprietary, and LLaMA v1 is open but not licensed for commercial purposes.
```

**5.** Besides its great potential benefits, Generative AI brings new risks and challenges for businesses and society. Which two statements are correct in terms of legal risks? (Choose 2)

* A. Businesses may be held responsible for any personal privacy rights violations resulting from Generative AI use.
* B. AI, being an emerging technology, is not subject to any regulations.
* C. Any content generated with AI can be freely used without worrying about IP rights.
* D. AI systems might be used for generating harmful content such as personalized fraud messages and malicious code.

```
A. Businesses may be held responsible for any personal privacy rights violations resulting from Generative AI use.  
D. AI systems might be used for generating harmful content such as personalized fraud messages and malicious code.  

Why:
AI is subject to regulations (B is false), and IP concerns still apply (C is false).
```

**6.** What is the correct order of fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) from general to specific?

* A. Deep Learning > Generative AI > Machine Learning
* B. Artificial Intelligence > Generative AI > Deep Learning
* C. Machine Learning > Deep Learning > Artificial Intelligence
* D. Artificial Intelligence > Deep Learning > Generative AI

```
D. Artificial Intelligence > Deep Learning > Generative AI

Why:
AI is the broadest field. Machine Learning (not listed here) is a subset of AI, Deep Learning is a subset of ML, and Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning.
```

---

**7.** Which two Databricks Lakehouse AI features are used in the production phase of Generative AI applications? (Choose 2)

* A. MLflow Evaluation
* B. Feature Serving
* C. Model Serving
* D. Lakehouse Monitoring

```
B. Feature Serving  
C. Model Serving  

Why:
These are used in production to provide real-time features and serve models. MLflow Evaluation is for testing, and Monitoring is for observability.
```

**8.** AI is considered to have both positive and negative impact on society in the future. Which three arguments are true? (Choose 3)

* A. AI automation may lead to job losses or displacement of some workers.
* B. Increased trust in AI systems may lead to unnoticed mistakes and loss of important skills.
* C. AI isn’t expected to bring any new privacy and security concerns.
* D. AI will positively impact the workforce by increasing efficiency and productivity.

```
A. AI automation may lead to job losses or displacement of some workers.  
B. Increased trust in AI systems may lead to unnoticed mistakes and loss of important skills.  
D. AI will positively impact the workforce by increasing efficiency and productivity.  

Why:
These reflect both the risks and opportunities of AI. Privacy/security concerns (C) are very real, so that option is false.
```

---

**9.** A user intentionally crafts instructions to manipulate the normal behavior of an AI model in an attempt to extract confidential information. What is the term used for this security issue?

* A. Bias
* B. Intellectual property violation
* C. Hallucination
* D. Prompt Injection

```
D. Prompt Injection

Why:
This refers to maliciously crafted inputs designed to override or manipulate the AI model. Bias is unfair preference, hallucination is making up facts, and IP violation is unrelated.
```

---

**10.** Generative AI is driving significant transformations across industries. What is a distinct competitive advantage for businesses in the field of AI?

* A. Significant reduction in the cost of utilizing SaaS LLM models.
* B. Proficiency in model development techniques.
* C. Unlocking the value of proprietary data within an organization.
* D. Access to high-quality open-source models.

```
C. Unlocking the value of proprietary data within an organization.

Why:
Unique proprietary data is a true differentiator, as it cannot be easily replicated by competitors. The other options provide benefits but are not lasting competitive advantages.
```

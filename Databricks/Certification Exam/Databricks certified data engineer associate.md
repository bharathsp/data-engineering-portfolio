What is databricks community edition 

Databricks lakehouse platform architecture:
1. Control plane - databricks account - Web UI, Cluster Management, workflows, notebook 
2. Data plane - customer cloud account - cluster VMS, storage dbfs

Storage organization of delta table

Primary format of data files - parquet 
Primary format of delta or transaction logs - json + crc

Delta time travel, delta vacuum with practical examples with code and log file structure in storage

Databricks repos

Week 2 ‚Äì Data Ingestion & Transformation

Ingestion

Auto Loader (schema inference, schema evolution, file notification vs directory listing mode)

COPY INTO command

Structured Streaming basics


Transformations

Spark SQL & DataFrame operations (select, filter, join, groupBy, window functions)

Functions (built-in, UDFs, Spark SQL functions)

Data types & null handling



‚è±Ô∏è Timeline: 5‚Äì6 days

Week 5 ‚Äì Practice & Mock Tests

Go through Databricks Academy practice exams (very important, exam is scenario-based).

Review sample questions: Most are multiple-choice & multiple-select.

Hands-on practice in Databricks Community Edition:

Load CSV/JSON data with Auto Loader.

Write transformations with PySpark/SQL.

Convert to Delta and try schema evolution.

Run queries with SQL warehouse.


Identify weak areas & revise.

<br><br>

At a high level, Databricks implements a **Lakehouse Architecture** — combining the openness and flexibility of a **data lake** with the performance and governance of a **data warehouse**.

---

## **1. Data Sources** 📂

* Raw data comes from multiple systems:

  * **Operational databases** (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  * **Streaming sources** (Kafka, IoT, Event Hubs)
  * **Files & APIs** (CSV, JSON, XML, REST APIs, SaaS apps)
  * **Cloud object stores** (AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, GCP GCS)

👉 This is the **landing zone** of all enterprise data.

---

## **2. Unified Databricks Architecture**

### a. **Ingest** 🔌

* Use **Lakeflow Connect** (no-code connectors) or APIs to bring in data.
* Supports **batch ingestion** (daily ETL jobs) and **real-time streaming** (Kafka/Event Hub).
* Stored in **Delta Lake** for reliability.

---

### b. **Transform** 🔄

* Process raw data into curated datasets.
* Tools: **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**, Spark SQL, PySpark, ML pipelines.
* Supports both **ETL** (extract-transform-load) and **ELT** (transform after load).
* Ensures **data quality** with built-in checks.

---

### c. **Query** 🔎

* Data is queryable using:

  * **Databricks SQL** (serverless warehouse experience)
  * **Delta Lake tables** (open format, optimized with Photon engine)
* Analysts, engineers, and data scientists can all query the same data.

---

### d. **Visualize** 📊

* Build **dashboards directly in Databricks SQL**.
* Or connect to external BI tools like **Power BI, Tableau, Looker**.
* Business teams get insights without moving data out.

---

### e. **Serve** ⚡

* Serve **machine learning models** and **AI applications** built on top of the Lakehouse.
* Use **Mosaic AI** for generative AI (LLMs, custom AI apps).
* Support APIs for serving **real-time predictions**.

---

### f. **Governance & Security** 🔑

* **Unity Catalog** provides:

  * Centralized metadata, lineage, and auditing
  * Fine-grained permissions (row/column level security)
  * Access policies for data + ML models
* Ensures compliance with enterprise security standards.

---

## **3. External Apps** 🖥️

* BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, Looker)
* Data science tools (Jupyter, RStudio)
* Business/operational apps consuming APIs or ML predictions
* Third-party data platforms integrating via **open formats (Parquet, Delta, Iceberg)**

👉 Databricks integrates seamlessly with the broader ecosystem.

## 🔹 What is Databricks Workflows?

* **Workflows** is the **orchestration layer** in Databricks.
* It lets you **schedule, automate, and manage data, analytics, and AI pipelines** in one place.
* Think of it as Databricks’ version of **Airflow / Control-M / Azure Data Factory**, but **natively integrated** into the Lakehouse.

## 🔹 Key Capabilities of Workflows

### 1. **Tasks** 🧩

* Each step in a workflow is called a **task**.
* A task can be:

  * 📝 Notebook
  * 🐍 Python / Scala / Java code
  * 📑 SQL query or dashboard refresh
  * ⚡ Delta Live Table pipeline
  * 🤖 ML model training or deployment

---

### 2. **Job Orchestration** ⏱️

* You chain tasks into **jobs** with dependencies.
* Supports **sequential or parallel execution**.
* Can trigger jobs on:

  * Schedule (cron)
  * Event (file arrival, API call)
  * Manual run

---

### 3. **Monitoring & Alerts** 🔔

* Built-in monitoring dashboard for job runs.
* Get alerts via email, Slack, or webhook when jobs fail.
* Logs and execution history available for debugging.

---

### 4. **Automation** 🤖

* Automates **end-to-end pipelines**:

  * Data ingestion → Transformation → Model Training → Dashboard refresh
* Ensures consistency and reduces manual intervention.

---

### 5. **Scalability & Reliability** ⚡

* Runs on **job clusters** (auto-provisioned, auto-terminated).
* Can use **task values** to pass parameters across tasks.
* Fault-tolerant: automatic retries and error handling.

## 🔹 Visual Flow

```
Workflow (Databricks)
   |
   ├── Task 1: Ingest Data (Notebook / DLT)
   ├── Task 2: Transform Data (PySpark / SQL)
   ├── Task 3: Train Model (MLflow)
   ├── Task 4: Serve Results (API / Dashboard)
   |
   └── Monitoring + Alerts
```

## 🔹 Why Workflows Matter

✅ Simplifies orchestration (no need for external schedulers).
✅ Unified for **data engineering, ML, and BI**.
✅ Reduces complexity and ensures reliability.
✅ Fully integrated with **Unity Catalog** for governance.

---

👉 **In short:**
Databricks **Workflows** is the built-in orchestration tool that lets you **schedule, run, and monitor pipelines (data + ML + BI)** end-to-end within the Databricks Lakehouse.

### **`-e` / `--env`**

* Sets **environment variables** inside the container.

### ðŸ”¹ What Are **Environment Variables**?

Environment variables are **key-value pairs** that are used to **configure the behavior of applications** without changing the code.

They act like **settings or inputs** that the program can read at runtime.
```bash
docker run -e APP_ENV=production myapp
```
The `-e` flag lets you **set environment variables inside the container** when it starts.

Here:

* `APP_ENV` is the **environment variable name**
* `production` is its **value**

So inside the container, the application can access:

```bash
echo $APP_ENV
# output: production
```

### ðŸ”¹ Why Are Environment Variables Useful?

#### âœ… **1. Configuration Without Code Change**

* You can switch between `development`, `testing`, `production` just by changing variables.
* Example: control debug logs using `DEBUG=true`

#### âœ… **2. Store Secrets and Keys**

* Avoid hardcoding sensitive info like passwords or API keys.

  ```bash
  docker run -e DB_PASSWORD=secret123 myapp
  ```

#### âœ… **3. Container Portability**

* Same Docker image can behave differently in different environments, just by changing environment variables.

### ðŸ”¹ Real-World Example

Suppose your app reads a config like this in Python:

```python
import os
env = os.getenv("APP_ENV", "development")
print(f"Running in {env} mode")
```

Then running:

```bash
docker run -e APP_ENV=production myapp
```

will output:

```
Running in production mode
```

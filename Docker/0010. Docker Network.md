### 🧭 `--network` in Docker

The `--network` flag in the `docker run` command is used to **connect the container to a specific Docker network**.

---

### 🔧 **Syntax**

```bash
docker run --network <network_name> <image_name>
```

Example:

```bash
docker run --network my_custom_net myapp
```

This runs the container from the `myapp` image and connects it to the Docker network named `my_custom_net`.

---

### 🔌 **Why Use `--network`?**

Docker containers can communicate with each other **only if they're on the same network**. By default, Docker uses a bridge network, but you can define your own custom networks for:

* Better **container-to-container communication**
* **Service isolation**
* **Name-based discovery** (e.g., `db` instead of IP addresses)

---

### 🧱 **How to Create a Custom Network**

Before using `--network`, you need to create the network:

```bash
docker network create my_custom_net
```

Then run containers on it:

```bash
docker run --network my_custom_net --name app1 myapp
docker run --network my_custom_net --name app2 anotherapp
```

These two containers can now talk to each other using their names (`app1`, `app2`).

### 🌐 **Types of Docker Networks**

| Network Type | Description                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bridge`     | Default network for containers on a single host                         |
| `host`       | Shares host's network (no isolation)                                    |
| `none`       | No networking                                                           |
| `overlay`    | Used for Docker Swarm; spans multiple hosts                             |
| `macvlan`    | Assigns a MAC address and behaves like a physical device on the network |

---

### 📌 Use Cases

* Microservices communicating with each other (e.g., app ↔ DB)
* Testing network behavior or isolation
* Running containers with different levels of network access

### 🧠 Summary

| Command                               | Meaning                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `--network my_custom_net`             | Connects container to `my_custom_net` |
| `docker network create my_custom_net` | Creates a user-defined bridge network |
| `--network host`                      | Shares host networking (no isolation) |
| `--network none`                      | Disables all networking               |

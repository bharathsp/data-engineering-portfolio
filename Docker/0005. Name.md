### **`--name`**

* Assigns a **custom name** to your container.

```bash
docker run --name my-nginx nginx
```
This command assigns the name `my-nginx` to the container instead of Docker auto-generating a random name like `relaxed_leavitt` or `vibrant_curie`.

### ðŸ”¹ Why Use `--name`?

1. **Easier to Identify & Manage:**

   * Instead of remembering container IDs or weird auto-names, you can use meaningful names.
   * Example:

     ```bash
     docker stop my-nginx
     docker logs my-nginx
     docker exec -it my-nginx bash
     ```

2. **Avoid Name Conflicts:**

   * You can ensure each container has a unique name.
   * If you rerun a container with the same name, Docker will tell you it already exists, helping you avoid duplicates.

3. **Useful in Scripts and Automation:**

   * When scripting Docker commands, having fixed names makes it easy to reference containers programmatically.

4. **Docker Networking:**

   * Containers can reach each other using their names as hostnames (in user-defined networks).

### ðŸ”¹ What Happens Without `--name`?

```bash
docker run nginx
```

* Docker gives the container a random, often silly name like `happy_wilson`.
* You must use the container ID or find the random name using `docker ps` to manage it.

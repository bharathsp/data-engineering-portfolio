### 🧼 `--no-cache` in Docker

The `--no-cache` option tells Docker to **build the image from scratch without using any cached intermediate layers** from previous builds.

---

### 🧱 **Command Syntax**

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t myapp .
```

This builds the image named `myapp`, **re-running every step** in the `Dockerfile`, ignoring any previously cached results.

### ⚙️ **How Docker Normally Builds Images (with Cache)**

By default, Docker uses a **layered cache system** to speed up builds. If a layer hasn’t changed (same instruction and inputs), Docker **reuses** that layer:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

COPY requirements.txt .       # ← If unchanged, this step uses cache
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  # ← If requirements.txt didn't change, cached layer is used
COPY . .                      # ← Cache used unless files change
```

This avoids repeating expensive operations like installing dependencies.

### ❌ **What Happens with `--no-cache`?**

When you use `--no-cache`, Docker **rebuilds every step**, even if nothing has changed:

* All `COPY` and `RUN` commands are re-executed
* All packages are freshly installed
* No previous build layers are reused

### ✅ **When to Use `--no-cache`**

| Scenario           | Why It Helps                                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Debugging          | Ensures no outdated files or packages are used from cache |
| Dependency updates | Forces re-installation of updated dependencies            |
| Build issues       | Helps rule out cache-related problems                     |

---

### 📌 Example

Suppose you ran:

```bash
docker build -t myapp .
```

...and it used cache. But now you want a **fresh build** (maybe new packages were released):

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t myapp .
```

This rebuilds everything **step by step** from scratch.

### ⚠️ Note

Using `--no-cache` **increases build time**, especially if your `Dockerfile` has steps like downloading packages or compiling code.

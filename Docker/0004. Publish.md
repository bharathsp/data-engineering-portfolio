### **`-p` / `--publish`**

* Maps a **host port** to a **container port** (`host:container`).

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
```

ðŸ“Œ *Exposes containerâ€™s port 80 on hostâ€™s port 8080.*
So in this case:

* `8080` is the **host port** (your local machine).
* `80` is the **container port** (inside the Nginx container).
  
ðŸ“Œ **It makes the containerâ€™s web server (running on port 80) accessible from your machine's port 8080.**

That means:
* The Nginx server inside the container is **listening on port 80** (default for web servers).
* Docker forwards **traffic from your computer's port 8080** to the container's port 80.
### ðŸ”¹ How to access it?

Once the container is running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You'll see the Nginx welcome page â€” even though Nginx is running inside the container on port 80, Docker routes that to your local port 8080.
### ðŸ”¹ Analogy:

Think of it like a receptionist forwarding a call:

* Someone calls your number (host port 8080).
* The receptionist (Docker) forwards it to the internal personâ€™s extension (container port 80).

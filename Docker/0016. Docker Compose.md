### ðŸ§± What is **Docker Compose**?

**Docker Compose** is a tool used to **define and run multi-container Docker applications** using a single YAML file (typically named `docker-compose.yml`).

Instead of running multiple `docker run` commands for each service (e.g., app, database, cache), you can define everything in a file and bring it all up with one command.

---

### ðŸ“„ Example `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"

  app:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

This defines a **three-service app**: a `web` server, an `app` container, and a `db` using PostgreSQL.

## ðŸš€ Commands

### âœ… `docker compose up -d`

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**What it does:**

* Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches containers as defined in `docker-compose.yml`
* The `-d` flag stands for **detached mode** â†’ runs containers in the background

ðŸ’¡ You can then check the running containers with:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

---

### ðŸ§¹ `docker compose down`

```bash
docker compose down
```

**What it does:**

* Stops all containers started by `docker compose up`
* Removes the containers, networks, and default volumes it created

ðŸ›‘ This is a clean shutdown â€” it removes everything that was spun up.

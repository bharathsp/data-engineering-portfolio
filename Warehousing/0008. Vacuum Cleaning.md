### 🧹 What is **Vacuum Cleaning** in Data Engineering?

In the context of **data lakes**, especially with **Delta Lake**, **Vacuum** is the **process of deleting old, unreferenced data files** that are **no longer needed** by the current or past versions of a table.

---

### 🔧 **Why is Vacuum Needed?**

When you **update**, **delete**, or **merge** data in Delta Lake, the old data files aren’t immediately removed — they’re kept for **Time Travel** and rollback. Over time, this can result in:

* Accumulation of obsolete files
* Increased storage costs
* Slower query performance

**Vacuum cleaning helps reclaim storage and improve performance.**

---

### ✅ **Delta Lake Vacuum Syntax (PySpark):**

```python
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/mnt/delta/my_table")

# Remove files older than 7 days (default retention period)
deltaTable.vacuum()
```

```python
# Optional: Set a custom retention period (in hours)
deltaTable.vacuum(retentionHours=24)  # Deletes files older than 24 hours
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: The default minimum retention is **168 hours (7 days)** to protect against accidental deletion needed for Time Travel.

---

### ⚠️ **Force Vacuum Before 7 Days?**

To bypass the 7-day safety window (not recommended in production unless Time Travel is disabled):

```python
spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.retentionDurationCheck.enabled", "false")
deltaTable.vacuum(0)  # Delete files immediately
```

---

### 🧠 Real-Life Analogy:

Think of Delta Lake as a versioned document editor (like Google Docs):

* Even if you delete content, older versions are saved for recovery.
* **Vacuum** is like clearing the document’s **version history** to free up space — **but only after you're sure you won’t need the old versions anymore.**

---

### 🧪 Example Use Case:

A retail company updates their product pricing daily. After a week:

* They **don’t need to access older versions**
* They run `VACUUM` to clean up old data files and save cloud storage costs

### 📌 Summary:

| Feature           | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Purpose           | Delete old data files no longer needed    |
| Applies to        | Delta Lake (Parquet + transaction logs)   |
| Default Retention | 7 days (168 hours)                        |
| Safe to use?      | Yes, but be cautious if using Time Travel |

### üè≠ Average Processing Time by Machine

You are given a table `Activity` that tracks when a machine starts and ends a process on a factory website. Each `(machine_id, process_id)` pair will always have one `'start'` and one `'end'` activity.

Your task is to **calculate the average time each machine takes to complete a process**, and return the result rounded to 3 decimal places.

### üìã Table: Activity

| Column Name   | Type     |
|---------------|----------|
| `machine_id`  | int      |
| `process_id`  | int      |
| `activity_type` | enum  |
| `timestamp`   | float    |

- `(machine_id, process_id, activity_type)` is the **primary key**.
- `activity_type` can be `'start'` or `'end'`.
- Each process has one `'start'` and one `'end'` entry.
- `'start'` always occurs before `'end'`.

### üß™ Example

#### Input:

| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
|------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |


#### Output:

| machine_id | processing_time |
|------------|-----------------|
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |

#### Explanation: 
- There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.
- Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894
- Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995
- Machine 2's average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = 1.456

### üßµ SQL Solution 1

```sql
SELECT 
    machine_id,
    ROUND(AVG(end_time - start_time), 3) AS processing_time
FROM (
    SELECT 
        machine_id,
        process_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END) AS start_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END) AS end_time
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY machine_id, process_id
) AS process_times
GROUP BY machine_id;
```

### üîç Explanation:

- Pivots `start` and `end` timestamps per `(machine_id, process_id)`
- Computes `end - start` per process
- Aggregates average by `machine_id` with 3 decimal rounding

### üßµ SQL Solution 2: Self Join

```sql
SELECT 
    a.machine_id,
    ROUND(AVG(b.timestamp - a.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity a
JOIN Activity b 
  ON a.machine_id = b.machine_id 
  AND a.process_id = b.process_id
  AND a.activity_type = 'start'
  AND b.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY a.machine_id;
```

### üîç Explanation:
- Join the table to itself matching on machine_id and process_id.
- Use filters to match `'start'` from one alias with `'end'` from the other.
- Calculate time difference and group by `machine_id`.

### üßµ SQL Solution 3: Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

```sql
WITH st AS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM Activity
    WHERE activity_type = 'start'
),
ed AS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM Activity
    WHERE activity_type = 'end'
)

SELECT 
    s.machine_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(e.timestamp - s.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time 
FROM st s
JOIN ed e 
    ON s.machine_id = e.machine_id 
   AND s.process_id = e.process_id 
GROUP BY s.machine_id;
```

### üîç Explanation:
- Same as the derived table approach but using a CTE for cleaner structure and readability.
- Often preferred in complex queries or for debugging step-by-step.

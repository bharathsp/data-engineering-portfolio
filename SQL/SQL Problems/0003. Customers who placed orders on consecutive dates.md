You have a table with `Date`, `CustomerID`, and `OrderID`. Write an SQL query to find **customers who placed orders on consecutive dates** (day after day, without gaps) and list those orders.

## **Sample Data**

| Date       | CustomerID | OrderID |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 01-01-2025 | C1         | 1       |
| 02-01-2025 | C1         | 2       |
| 21-02-2025 | C2         | 3       |
| 22-02-2025 | C2         | 4       |
| 20-01-2025 | C3         | 5       |
| 25-02-2025 | C3         | 6       |

## **SQL Solution (Using `LAG` to Check Consecutive Days)**

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, OrderID, Date
FROM (
    SELECT 
        CustomerID,
        OrderID,
        Date,
        LAG(Date) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID ORDER BY Date) AS PrevDate
    FROM Orders
) t
WHERE Date - PrevDate = 1;
```

---

### **Explanation**

* **`LAG(Date)`** → Looks at the previous order date for each customer.
* **`PARTITION BY CustomerID`** → Ensures the check is done per customer.
* **`ORDER BY Date`** → Orders the data chronologically for the comparison.
* **`Date - PrevDate = 1`** → Filters only those rows where the current date is exactly **1 day** after the previous date (i.e., consecutive days).

## **Expected Output**

| CustomerID | OrderID | Date       |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- |
| C1         | 2       | 02-01-2025 |
| C2         | 4       | 22-02-2025 |

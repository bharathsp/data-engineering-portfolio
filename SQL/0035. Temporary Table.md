## 📌 What is a **Temporary Table** in SQL?

👉 A **Temporary Table (Temp Table)** is a special kind of table that is **stored in the database temporarily**.
It exists only for the **duration of your session** or until you **explicitly drop it**.

Think of it as a **scratchpad** 📝 you can use to store intermediate results while working with complex queries.

---

## 🎯 Why Use Temp Tables?

* ✅ To **store intermediate results** during query execution.
* ✅ To **break down complex queries** into smaller steps.
* ✅ To **improve performance** by avoiding recalculations.
* ✅ To **hold data temporarily** for transformations before inserting into permanent tables.

## 🛠️ Example Use Case

Imagine you have a table:

📦 **Sales**

| SaleID | CustomerID | Amount | SaleDate   |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1      | 101        | 500    | 2023-01-01 |
| 2      | 102        | 700    | 2023-01-02 |
| 3      | 101        | 300    | 2023-02-01 |

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Create a Temp Table

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE TempCustomerSales AS
SELECT CustomerID, SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY CustomerID;
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Query the Temp Table

```sql
SELECT * FROM TempCustomerSales WHERE TotalSales > 600;
```

✅ Result:

| CustomerID | TotalSales |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 101        | 800        |
| 102        | 700        |

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Drop the Temp Table (optional)

```sql
DROP TABLE TempCustomerSales;
```

If you don’t drop it, most SQL engines will **auto-delete** it once your session ends.

---

✅ **Summary**

* Temp table = short-term table
* Exists **only during the session**
* Useful for **breaking down big queries, improving performance, and temporary storage**

# ⚖️ SQL `WHERE` vs `HAVING` Clause

Both `WHERE` and `HAVING` are filtering clauses in SQL, but they serve different purposes depending on the stage of query execution.

---

## 🔍 `WHERE` Clause

### ✅ **Purpose**
Filters individual **rows** before any grouping occurs.

### 🛠️ **Usage**
Used with `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements to filter rows based on specific conditions.

### 🧾 **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### 📌 **Example**
Suppose we have a `students` table:

| student_id | name   | score |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 1          | Alice  | 85    |
| 2          | Bob    | 78    |
| 3          | Carol  | 92    |

**Query**: Retrieve students with a score greater than 80

```sql
SELECT name, score
FROM students
WHERE score > 80;
```

## 📦 `HAVING` Clause

### ✅ **Purpose**
Filters **groups of rows** after grouping is performed using `GROUP BY`.

### 🛠️ **Usage**
Used with `SELECT` statements and aggregate functions to apply conditions to grouped data.

### 🧾 **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;
```

### 📌 **Example**
Suppose we have an `employees` table:

| employee_id | department | salary |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| 1           | HR         | 40000  |
| 2           | IT         | 60000  |
| 3           | HR         | 55000  |
| 4           | IT         | 52000  |

**Query**: Find departments with average salary greater than 50000

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```

## 🧠 Key Differences

| Feature       | `WHERE`                        | `HAVING`                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Filters       | Rows                           | Groups of rows                    |
| When Applied  | Before grouping                | After grouping                    |
| Used With     | Any SQL query                  | Typically used with `GROUP BY`    |
| Aggregates    | Cannot filter on aggregates    | Can filter on aggregates          |

## 📝 Summary

- 🧼 Use `WHERE` to filter **raw data rows** before any aggregation.
- 🧮 Use `HAVING` to filter **grouped data** after aggregation.
- Combining both allows powerful data analysis with precision.

Understanding the distinction between `WHERE` and `HAVING` enables crafting more accurate and effective SQL queries.

Let's walk through how `SUM()` behaves with `OVER` using:

1. Only `PARTITION BY`
2. Only `ORDER BY`
3. Both `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY`

We’ll use this sample **Employees** table:

| Name  | Department | Salary |
| ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| Alice | HR         | 5000   |
| Bob   | IT         | 6000   |
| Carol | HR         | 5500   |
| David | IT         | 6500   |
| Eve   | IT         | 7000   |
| Frank | HR         | 5200   |

### **1. `SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department)`**

```sql
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
  SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department) AS DeptTotal
FROM Employees;
```

✅ **Explanation:**
Calculates **total salary per department**. No ordering.

| Name  | Dept | Salary | DeptTotal |
| ----- | ---- | ------ | --------- |
| Alice | HR   | 5000   | 15700     |
| Carol | HR   | 5500   | 15700     |
| Frank | HR   | 5200   | 15700     |
| Bob   | IT   | 6000   | 19500     |
| David | IT   | 6500   | 19500     |
| Eve   | IT   | 7000   | 19500     |

### **2. `SUM(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY Salary)`**

```sql
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
  SUM(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY Salary) AS RunningTotal
FROM Employees;
```

✅ **Explanation:**
Calculates **running total of salary**, across **all employees** sorted by salary.

| Name  | Dept | Salary | RunningTotal           |
| ----- | ---- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Alice | HR   | 5000   | 5000                   |
| Frank | HR   | 5200   | 10200                  |
| Bob   | IT   | 6000   | 16200                  |
| Carol | HR   | 5500   | 21700                  |
| David | IT   | 6500   | 28200                  |
| Eve   | IT   | 7000   | 35200                  |

### **3. `SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary)`**

```sql
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
  SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary) AS DeptRunningTotal
FROM Employees;
```

✅ **Explanation:**
Calculates **running total within each department**, sorted by salary.

| Name  | Dept | Salary | DeptRunningTotal |
| ----- | ---- | ------ | ---------------- |
| Alice | HR   | 5000   | 5000             |
| Frank | HR   | 5200   | 10200            |
| Carol | HR   | 5500   | 15700            |
| Bob   | IT   | 6000   | 6000             |
| David | IT   | 6500   | 12500            |
| Eve   | IT   | 7000   | 19500            |

### ✅ Summary of Differences:

| Clause         | What It Does                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `PARTITION BY` | Groups data before applying aggregate                 |
| `ORDER BY`     | Controls cumulative calculation order (running total) |
| Both combined  | Running total **within each group**                   |

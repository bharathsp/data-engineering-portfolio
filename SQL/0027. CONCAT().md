# 🔗 CONCAT() Function in SQL

---

# 🌟 What is CONCAT()?

- The **CONCAT()** function **joins two or more strings** into a single string.
- If any argument is **NULL**, **CONCAT()** treats it as an **empty string** (instead of returning NULL).

---

# ✏️ Syntax:
```sql
SELECT CONCAT(string1, string2, ..., stringN) AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

---

# 📋 Example:
```sql
SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName
FROM Employees;
```
- This will combine `FirstName` and `LastName` with a space `' '` in between.
- If `FirstName = 'John'` and `LastName = 'Doe'`, the output will be `'John Doe'`.

# ⚡ Key Points:

| Icon | Feature | Details |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🧩 | Multiple Strings | You can concatenate two, three, or even more strings at once. |
| 🚫 | NULL Handling | NULL values are automatically treated as empty strings (not NULL). |
| 🛠️ | Usage | Useful for creating full names, addresses, dynamic messages, or any combined output. |

---

# 🔥 Bonus Tip:
- If you want to add separators between values, you must include them manually as additional arguments in `CONCAT()`.

🔹 Example:
```sql
SELECT CONCAT(City, ', ', Country) AS Location
FROM Locations;
```
If City = 'Paris' and Country = 'France', output ➔ **Paris, France**

---

# 🚀 Related Function:
- **CONCAT_WS(separator, string1, string2, ...)** → It allows you to **specify a separator** automatically between strings.
  
🔹 Example:
```sql
SELECT CONCAT_WS(' - ', FirstName, LastName, Department) AS EmployeeInfo
FROM Employees;
```
(Here, fields will be separated by `' - '`.)

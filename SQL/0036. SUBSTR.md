## 📌 What is **`SUBSTR`** in SQL?

👉 `SUBSTR` (short for **Substring**) is a **string function** in SQL that extracts a portion of text (substring) from a given string.

It’s like cutting a piece of cake 🎂 from a bigger cake 🍰.

## 🛠️ Syntax

```sql
SUBSTR(string, start_position, length)
```

* **string** → The text you want to extract from.
* **start\_position** → The position where extraction begins (1-based index in most SQL dialects).
* **length** (optional) → How many characters to extract.

## 🎯 Examples

### Example 1: Extract first 3 letters of a name

```sql
SELECT SUBSTR('Bharath', 1, 3) AS Result;
```

✅ Output → `"Bha"`

---

### Example 2: Extract from middle

```sql
SELECT SUBSTR('Agile Innovations', 7, 4) AS Result;
```

✅ Output → `" Inno"`

---

### Example 3: Extract till end

```sql
SELECT SUBSTR('DataEngineering', 5) AS Result;
```

✅ Output → `"Engineering"`

(Since no length is given, it takes everything till the end.)

Let’s take the word: **"PYTHON" 🐍**

* `SUBSTR('PYTHON', 1, 3)` → **PYT** ✂️
* `SUBSTR('PYTHON', 4, 3)` → **HON** ✂️
* `SUBSTR('PYTHON', 3)` → **THON** ✂️ (till the end)

➡️ **"PYTHON" ➝ ✂️ ➝ "PYT" / "HON" / "THON"**

## ✅ Summary

* **`SUBSTR` = Extract part of a string**
* Used for formatting, cleaning, or analyzing text data
* Common in tasks like:

  * Extracting **year** from a date string 📅

## ðŸ”„ Difference Between `BETWEEN` and `IN`

| Feature      | `BETWEEN`                      | `IN`                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Use Case     | Range of values                | Specific discrete values              |
| Inclusive?   | Yes (includes boundary values) | Yes                                  |
| Flexibility  | Less flexible (only range)     | More flexible (any number of values) |

### ðŸ’¡ Tip:
Use `BETWEEN` when dealing with continuous ranges like dates, prices, or ages.  
Use `IN` when filtering based on a known set of discrete values.

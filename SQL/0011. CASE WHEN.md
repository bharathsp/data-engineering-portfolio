### 📘 `CASE WHEN` in SQL

The `CASE WHEN` expression in SQL is used for **conditional logic**, allowing you to transform or categorize data based on specified conditions.

---

### 🧠 Syntax

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE result_default  -- (Optional)
END
```

---

### 🔍 Explanation

- `CASE` ➤ Begins the conditional logic block  
- `WHEN condition` ➤ Specifies the condition to evaluate  
- `THEN result` ➤ Value returned if the condition is true  
- `ELSE result_default` ➤ Value returned if none of the conditions match (optional)  
- `END` ➤ Closes the `CASE` block

### 🎓 Example

Suppose we have a table called `students` with the columns:  
- `student_id`  
- `name`  
- `score`  

We want to **categorize students based on their score** into:
- Excellent
- Good
- Average
- Needs Improvement

```sql
SELECT 
    student_id,
    name,
    score,
    CASE 
        WHEN score >= 90 THEN 'Excellent'
        WHEN score >= 75 THEN 'Good'
        WHEN score >= 50 THEN 'Average'
        ELSE 'Needs Improvement'
    END AS performance_category
FROM 
    students;
```

### 🧾 Output Sample

| student_id | name     | score | performance_category |
|------------|----------|-------|----------------------|
| 101        | Alice    | 92    | Excellent            |
| 102        | Bob      | 78    | Good                 |
| 103        | Charlie  | 55    | Average              |
| 104        | Diana    | 40    | Needs Improvement    |

### ✅ Use Cases

- Categorizing numeric values into labels (e.g., scores → grades)
- Creating derived columns based on conditions
- Simplifying `IF-ELSE` logic within SQL queries
- Data transformation within `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, etc.

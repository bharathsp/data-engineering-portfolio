# 🧑‍💼 Managers with at least 5 Direct Reports

## 📋 Table: `Employee`

| Column Name | Type    | Description                        |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| `id`        | `int`   | Primary key                        |
| `name`      | `varchar` | Employee's name                  |
| `department`| `varchar` | Department of the employee       |
| `managerId` | `int`   | ID of the employee's manager       |

- 🧷 `id` is the primary key.
- 📌 `managerId` is `NULL` if the employee has **no manager**.
- 🚫 No employee manages themselves.

## 🧠 Hints

- Use `GROUP BY` on `managerId` to count direct reports.
- Use a `HAVING` clause to filter managers with **5 or more** reports.
- Join the `Employee` table with itself to retrieve the manager’s `name`.

## ✅ Solution

```sql
SELECT e1.name
FROM Employee e1
JOIN (
    SELECT managerId
    FROM Employee
    WHERE managerId IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY managerId
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
) e2
ON e1.id = e2.managerId;

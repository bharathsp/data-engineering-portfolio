### 🔍 What is **Query Tuning** in SQL?

**Query tuning** (or **SQL performance tuning**) is the process of **analyzing and optimizing SQL queries** so they run **faster**, consume **fewer resources**, and **improve overall database performance**.

---

## 🎯 **Goal of Query Tuning**

* 🕒 Reduce query **execution time**
* ⚙️ Reduce **CPU and memory** usage
* 📉 Minimize **disk I/O**
* 🚀 Improve **throughput and responsiveness** of applications

## 🔧 Common Query Tuning Techniques

### 1️⃣ **Use Proper Indexing**

* Indexes speed up search and WHERE clause filters.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_lastname ON Customers (LastName);
```

### 2️⃣ **Avoid SELECT**

* Only fetch the required columns, not everything.

```sql
-- Bad
SELECT * FROM Orders;

-- Good
SELECT OrderID, OrderDate FROM Orders;
```

### 3️⃣ **Use EXISTS Instead of IN (for subqueries)**

```sql
-- Less Efficient
SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);

-- More Efficient
SELECT * FROM Customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM Orders o WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
);
```

### 4️⃣ **Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns in WHERE**

```sql
-- Slower: function disables index
WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2023

-- Faster: preserves index
WHERE OrderDate >= '2023-01-01' AND OrderDate < '2024-01-01'
```

### 5️⃣ **Use Joins Smartly**

* Replace correlated subqueries with **JOINs** when possible.

```sql
-- Less Efficient
SELECT Name FROM Customers 
WHERE CustomerID IN (
  SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders WHERE OrderTotal > 100
);

-- Better
SELECT DISTINCT c.Name 
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE o.OrderTotal > 100;
```

### 6️⃣ **Analyze Execution Plan**

Use tools like:

* `EXPLAIN` (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
* `EXPLAIN PLAN` (Oracle)
* SQL Server Execution Plan (SSMS)

These show:

* Index usage
* Join order
* Table scans
* Cost estimation

## 🧪 Example: Before vs After Tuning

### ❌ **Before Tuning**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders 
WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2023;
```

* No index usage (function on column)
* Full table scan

### ✅ **After Tuning**

```sql
SELECT OrderID, CustomerID 
FROM Orders 
WHERE OrderDate >= '2023-01-01' AND OrderDate < '2024-01-01';
```

* Uses index on `OrderDate`
* Fetches only required columns

| Tip                           | Benefit                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Limit result set with `LIMIT` | Prevent over-fetching               |
| Use appropriate `JOIN` types  | Avoid unnecessary data loads        |
| Denormalize if needed         | Reduce expensive joins              |
| Use `WITH` (CTEs) for clarity | Clean and reusable queries          |
| Partition large tables        | Improve scan and filter performance |

* Slow page loads or reports
* Large datasets or high concurrency
* High CPU, memory, or I/O load
* Full table scans observed

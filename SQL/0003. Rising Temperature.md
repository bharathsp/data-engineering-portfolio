### 🌡️ Rising Temperature

You are given a table `Weather` that contains daily temperature records. Your task is to find the `id`s of all dates where the temperature was **higher than the previous day**.

#### 🧾 Table: Weather

| Column Name  | Type   |
|--------------|--------|
| `id`         | int    |
| `recordDate` | date   |
| `temperature`| int    |

- `id` is the unique identifier for each record.
- There are **no duplicate** `recordDate` values.

### 🧪 Example

#### Input:

Weather table:
| id | recordDate | temperature |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |


#### Output:

| id |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |

#### 🧠 Explanation:
- On `2015-01-02`, the temperature increased from `10` to `25`.
- On `2015-01-04`, the temperature increased from `20` to `30`.

### 🧵 SQL Solution 1

```sql
SELECT W1.id
FROM Weather W1
JOIN Weather W2 
  ON DATE_SUB(W1.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY) = W2.recordDate
WHERE W1.temperature > W2.temperature;
```

> ✅ `DATE_SUB(W1.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)` ensures we're comparing a date to its immediate previous day.  
> ✅ We only select the `id` of records with a higher temperature than the previous day.

---
### 🧵 SQL Solution 2

```sql
SELECT w2.id
FROM Weather w1
INNER JOIN Weather w2
  ON w1.id = w2.id-1
WHERE w2.temperature > w1.temperature;
```
> ✅ We only select the `id` of records with a higher temperature than the previous day.

### üîç What is **Indexing in SQL**?

**Indexing** in SQL is a **performance optimization technique** that speeds up the retrieval of rows from a database table.

---

### üìò Basic Definition:

An **index** is a **data structure** (typically a B-tree or hash) associated with a table column(s) that helps the **database engine locate rows faster**, just like an index in a book helps you find topics quickly.

---

### ‚úÖ Why Use Indexes?

Without an index, SQL must perform a **full table scan**, checking every row to find matches ‚Äî slow for large datasets.

With an index:

* Searches become faster (e.g., using `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or `ORDER BY`).
* Improves performance of read-heavy queries.

### üß± Types of Indexes:

| Type                    | Description                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-column index** | Index on one column                                |
| **Composite index**     | Index on multiple columns                          |
| **Unique index**        | Ensures all values in a column are unique          |
| **Full-text index**     | For fast searching of string data                  |
| **Clustered index**     | Sorts the table physically (usually one per table) |
| **Non-clustered index** | Separate structure from data (can have many)       |

---

### üß™ Example:

```sql
-- Create an index on the "email" column in the "users" table
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);
```

Now this query will be faster:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'abc@example.com';
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations:

* Indexes **consume storage**.
* **Too many indexes** slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.
* Indexes need to be **maintained** as data changes.

---

### üß† Tip:

Use indexes on columns that are frequently:

* Filtered in `WHERE`
* Joined in `JOIN`
* Ordered in `ORDER BY`
* Grouped in `GROUP BY`

**Trino** (formerly known as **PrestoSQL**) is a **distributed SQL query engine** designed to query **large amounts of data** across many different data sources — **without moving the data**.

👉 Think of it as a **federated query engine**:

* You can query **Hive, Kafka, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Delta Lake, BigQuery, etc.**
* Using just **standard SQL**.

*Trino is a query engine and not a database*

---

# 🛠️ **Key Features**

* 🔗 **Federated Queries** → Query across multiple systems in one SQL query.
* ⚡ **High Performance** → MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) execution.
* 🧑‍💻 **ANSI SQL Support** → Familiar to data analysts & engineers.
* 🌍 **Scales Horizontally** → Runs on clusters (similar to Spark).
* 🔌 **Connectors** → Many built-in connectors for databases, data lakes, and cloud storage.

# 🏗️ **How Trino Works**

1. **Client submits SQL query** (e.g., `SELECT * FROM hive.orders JOIN mysql.customers`).
2. **Coordinator node**: Parses query, creates execution plan.
3. **Worker nodes**: Execute tasks in parallel.
4. **Results returned** → combined and sent back to client.

# 📊 **Example Use Cases**

* 🔎 **Data Lakehouse Analytics**
  → Query **Parquet/ORC files in S3/GCS/HDFS** using SQL.

* 🔗 **Cross-Database Joins**
  → Join **orders in Hive** with **customer data in MySQL**.

* 📈 **Ad-hoc Analytics at Scale**
  → Run BI dashboards on **petabytes of data**.

* ☁️ **Multi-cloud / Hybrid Data**
  → Query **AWS S3 + GCP BigQuery + On-prem Oracle** together.

# 🖼️ **Analogy**

Imagine a **universal translator 🗣️**:

* Each person speaks a different language (MySQL, Hive, Kafka, BigQuery).
* Trino is the **translator** → you speak **SQL** and it talks to all of them.

---

# ✅ **Advantages**

* ⚡ Very fast for interactive queries (low latency).
* 🛠️ Works with many data sources (federated).
* 📊 Perfect for BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Superset).
* 🧑‍💻 Easy adoption (uses SQL).

# ❌ **Disadvantages**

* 🚫 Not meant for **ETL/batch jobs** (use Spark for heavy transformations).
* 🚧 Limited support for **complex ML pipelines**.
* 📦 Needs cluster setup & tuning (though **Trino on Kubernetes** and **Starburst** simplify this).

---

# 📌 **Summary**

* **Trino = distributed SQL query engine** for querying **any data source**.
* Built for **federated queries**, **ad-hoc analytics**, and **BI dashboards**.
* Complements (not replaces) Spark:

  * Trino = fast SQL queries.
  * Spark = heavy ETL/ML workloads.

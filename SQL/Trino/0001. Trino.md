**Trino** (formerly known as **PrestoSQL**) is a **distributed SQL query engine** designed to query **large amounts of data** across many different data sources — **without moving the data**.

👉 Think of it as a **federated query engine**:

* You can query **Hive, Kafka, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Delta Lake, BigQuery, etc.**
* Using just **standard SQL**.

*Trino is a query engine and not a database*

---

# 🛠️ **Key Features**

* 🔗 **Federated Queries** → Query across multiple systems in one SQL query.
* ⚡ **High Performance** → MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) execution.
* 🧑‍💻 **ANSI SQL Support** → Familiar to data analysts & engineers.
* 🌍 **Scales Horizontally** → Runs on clusters (similar to Spark).
* 🔌 **Connectors** → Many built-in connectors for databases, data lakes, and cloud storage.

# 🏗️ **How Trino Works**

1. **Client submits SQL query** (e.g., `SELECT * FROM hive.orders JOIN mysql.customers`).
2. **Coordinator node**: Parses query, creates execution plan.
3. **Worker nodes**: Execute tasks in parallel.
4. **Results returned** → combined and sent back to client.

# 📊 **Example Use Cases**

* 🔎 **Data Lakehouse Analytics**
  → Query **Parquet/ORC files in S3/GCS/HDFS** using SQL.

* 🔗 **Cross-Database Joins**
  → Join **orders in Hive** with **customer data in MySQL**.

* 📈 **Ad-hoc Analytics at Scale**
  → Run BI dashboards on **petabytes of data**.

* ☁️ **Multi-cloud / Hybrid Data**
  → Query **AWS S3 + GCP BigQuery + On-prem Oracle** together.

# 🖼️ **Analogy**

Imagine a **universal translator 🗣️**:

* Each person speaks a different language (MySQL, Hive, Kafka, BigQuery).
* Trino is the **translator** → you speak **SQL** and it talks to all of them.

---

# ✅ **Advantages**

* ⚡ Very fast for interactive queries (low latency).
* 🛠️ Works with many data sources (federated).
* 📊 Perfect for BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Superset).
* 🧑‍💻 Easy adoption (uses SQL).

# ❌ **Disadvantages**

* 🚫 Not meant for **ETL/batch jobs** (use Spark for heavy transformations).
* 🚧 Limited support for **complex ML pipelines**.
* 📦 Needs cluster setup & tuning (though **Trino on Kubernetes** and **Starburst** simplify this).

---

# 📌 **Summary**

* **Trino = distributed SQL query engine** for querying **any data source**.
* Built for **federated queries**, **ad-hoc analytics**, and **BI dashboards**.
* Complements (not replaces) Spark:

  * Trino = fast SQL queries.
  * Spark = heavy ETL/ML workloads.

# Trino vs Spark

Trino is generally faster than Apache Spark for interactive SQL queries because it is optimized for low-latency, in-memory, pipelined distributed SQL execution. Trino runs queries by pushing processing to where the data lives and executes all query stages concurrently, which reduces overhead and response time significantly compared to Spark.

### Performance Comparison
- A recent benchmark using the TPC-DS dataset showed Trino completed all queries in about 4,442 seconds on average while Spark took around 15,678 seconds, making Trino roughly 3.5 times faster overall for this workload.
- The average response time per query was about 17.49 seconds for Trino versus 37.65 seconds for Spark, again demonstrating Trino's speed advantage for analytic queries.
- Trino avoids scheduling overhead from lazy execution that Spark has, where Spark must negotiate cluster resources for each stage before processing.
- However, Spark is more versatile and excels at complex ETL tasks, machine learning, and fault tolerance, trading off some speed for these capabilities.

### Use Case Suitability
- Trino is the better choice for fast, ad-hoc, interactive analytical queries over large datasets and federated data sources.
- Spark is preferred for complex data transformations, streaming, ML pipelines, and fault-tolerant batch processing needs.

In summary, Trino outperforms Spark in speed for SQL query analytics and interactive workloads, while Spark offers broader functionality at the cost of some latency.

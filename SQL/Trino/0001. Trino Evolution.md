## 🚀 Evolution of Trino (and Big Data Query Engines)

### 1️⃣ Early Big Data Challenges

* 🌐 **Exponential growth of web pages** after the advent of the World Wide Web.
* ⚡ **Challenge:** Quickly process massive datasets for search and analytics.
* 🖥️ **Problem:** Traditional disk-to-server architectures faced network bottlenecks due to decoupled compute and storage.

---

### 2️⃣ Google Innovations

* **2001 – MapReduce & Google File System (GFS)**

  * 🗂️ GFS: Large files are split into **chunks** and distributed across a cluster.
  * 💡 **Key benefit:** Data locality – compute cores are collocated with data to reduce network traffic.
  * 🔄 MapReduce: Sends computation to where data resides instead of moving large data across the network.

---

### 3️⃣ Hadoop Ecosystem

* **2006 – Hadoop (Apache)**

  * 🎯 Clone of Google File System + MapReduce for open-source use.
  * 📊 Allows distributed batch processing over large datasets.

* **2007–2008 – Hive (Facebook → Apache Hive)**

  * 🏗️ Hive: SQL-like abstraction on Hadoop to allow non-Java programmers to query HDFS data.
  * ⚠️ Limitation: Hive queries were slower due to MapReduce’s batch-oriented architecture.

---

### 4️⃣ Presto / Trino

* **2012 – Presto (Facebook)**

  * ⚡ Designed to **run queries in memory**, enabling fast interactive SQL queries.
  * 🌐 Query multiple data sources: HDFS, object storage, relational DBs, document stores, columnar stores.
  * 🏎️ Faster than Hive due to in-memory processing.

* **2013 – Apache Presto**

<img width="200" height="145" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51ca9d7c-637a-4e98-b76a-ff27530d5dda" />

  * Open-source release of Facebook Presto.

* **2019 – Presto Forks**

  * ⚔️ **PrestoSQL** forked from PrestoDB for active development.

* **2020 – PrestoSQL → Trino**

<img width="200" height="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71b26de4-6c51-40f7-a102-7c146ad06d8d" />

  * 🔄 Renamed Trino to avoid confusion.
  * 🛠️ Connectors map SQL queries to various systems:

    * MongoDB → method calls
    * Kafka → each message as a row
    * Redis → each key-value pair as a row
  * ⚡ Optimizations:

    * Pushdown filters (filter early to reduce data movement)
    * Reduce memory usage
    * Minimize network traffic
  * ✅ **Goal:** Unified, fast SQL query engine for multiple data sources.

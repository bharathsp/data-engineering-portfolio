# ðŸ”¹ Trino Architecture

Trino follows a **masterâ€“worker architecture** with three main layers:

---

## 1. **Coordinator**

* The **brain** of the Trino cluster.
* Responsibilities:

  * Accepts SQL queries from clients (JDBC/ODBC/CLI).
  * Parses and analyzes queries.
  * Creates an **execution plan** (distributed DAG).
  * Assigns tasks to **workers**.
  * Tracks progress and aggregates results.
* Only **one coordinator** in a cluster (for HA, you can run standby coordinators).

---

## 2. **Workers**

* The **execution engines** of Trino.
* Each worker:

  * Executes tasks (query fragments).
  * Reads/writes data from connectors (HDFS, S3, Hive, Kafka, RDBMS, etc.).
  * Exchanges intermediate results with other workers (via Trinoâ€™s shuffle mechanism).
* Workers are **stateless** â†’ you can scale them up or down easily.

---

## 3. **Connectors**

* Trino doesnâ€™t store data â†’ it queries external systems using **connectors**.
* Each connector maps Trino schemas/tables to an external data source.
* Supported systems:

  * **Data lakes**: Hive, Iceberg, Delta Lake, Hudi
  * **Object stores**: S3, ADLS, GCS
  * **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server
  * **Streaming**: Kafka, Kinesis
  * **Other engines**: Elasticsearch, Cassandra, MongoDB
* This makes Trino a **federated query engine**.

---

## 4. **Clients**

* Applications and users connect using:

  * JDBC / ODBC drivers
  * Trino CLI
  * BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Superset, Looker)
* Queries go to the **Coordinator**, then execution is distributed to **Workers**.

# ðŸ”¹ Trino Query Flow (Step-by-step)

1. **Client submits query** (SQL) â†’ Coordinator.
2. **Coordinator parses & plans** query â†’ logical & physical execution plan.
3. **Coordinator splits** query into stages â†’ tasks assigned to workers.
4. **Workers fetch data** from connectors, process, and shuffle results between them.
5. **Final results** are collected by the Coordinator â†’ sent back to client.

# ðŸ”¹ Key Strengths of Trino Architecture

âœ… **Separation of compute & storage** â†’ scale workers independently.
âœ… **Federated queries** â†’ query across multiple sources in a single SQL.
âœ… **In-memory, pipelined execution** â†’ very fast for interactive analytics.
âœ… **Pluggable connectors** â†’ extend to any data source.
âœ… **Stateless workers** â†’ easy elasticity & fault recovery.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:

* **Coordinator** = Brain (query parsing, planning, scheduling).
* **Workers** = Muscles (execution, data retrieval, shuffling).
* **Connectors** = Eyes/ears (data access layer).

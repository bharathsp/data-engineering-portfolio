# 📌 What is Federation in Trino?

* 🌐 **Federation** = Ability to query **multiple heterogeneous data sources** in a single query.
* ⚡ Trino was **built for federation** → It doesn’t store data itself but queries external systems via **connectors**.
* 🔗 You can join data across **databases, warehouses, and object stores** (e.g., MySQL + Hive + Kafka + MongoDB).

# ⚙️ How Trino Handles Federated Queries

1. **Connectors** 🛠

   * Each source (Hive, MySQL, Iceberg, Elasticsearch, Kafka, etc.) is plugged into Trino via a connector.
   * They expose schemas and tables to Trino’s SQL engine.

2. **Single Query Across Sources** 🔄

   * Trino parses the query, then pushes down as much work as possible to each source (**predicate pushdown, projection pushdown, aggregation pushdown**).

3. **Data Fetch + Execution** 📦

   * Data is fetched in parallel from each source.
   * Trino’s execution engine joins/aggregates the results in-memory across worker nodes.

4. **Unified Result** 📊

   * The query result looks like it came from **one database**, even though it spanned multiple systems.

# ✅ Example: Federated Query in Trino

Suppose you have:

* 🛒 **Orders** in Hive
* 👤 **Customers** in MySQL

You can join them directly:

```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, SUM(o.amount) AS total_spent
FROM mysql.sales.customers c
JOIN hive.retail.orders o 
  ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE '2025-09-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name;
```

👉 Trino:

* Pushes filter (`o.order_date >= '2025-09-01'`) down to Hive.
* Reads customers from MySQL.
* Joins the results **inside Trino’s distributed engine**.

# ⚡ Federation Optimizations in Trino

* 🔽 **Predicate Pushdown** → Filters applied at source to reduce data scanned.
* ✂️ **Projection Pushdown** → Only required columns fetched.
* 📊 **Aggregation Pushdown** → Some aggregations executed at source if supported.
* 🚀 **Join Reordering** → Optimizer may broadcast or repartition tables for efficient joins.

---

# 🚫 Challenges of Federation

* ⚖️ **Performance imbalance** → Sources with different speeds (e.g., Hive vs MySQL).
* ⏱ **Latency** → Queries may wait on the slowest system.
* 🔄 **Data movement** → Large cross-source joins require network shuffles.
* 🔒 **Security/Governance** → Different sources may have different access rules.

---

# 🖼️ Visual Summary

* 🗄️ Multiple sources (Hive, MySQL, Kafka, MongoDB, Snowflake).
* 🌐 Trino connects via **connectors**.
* 🔗 Query spans sources.
* 🚀 Trino engine fetches, optimizes, joins, and returns **one unified result**.

💡 Pro Tip:
Federation in Trino is **best for analytics and exploration**, but for production-grade performance at scale, consider **materializing federated joins** into a single system (via ETL or MVs).

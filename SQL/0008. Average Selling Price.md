# Average Selling Price

---

âœ¨ **Tables Given:**

ðŸ“¦ **Prices**

| Column Name | Type |
|:------------|:-----|
| product_id  | int  |
| start_date  | date |
| end_date    | date |
| price       | int  |

Primary Key âž” (`product_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`)

- Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
- For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.

ðŸ“ˆ **UnitsSold**

| Column Name | Type |
|:------------|:-----|
| product_id  | int  |
| purchase_date | date |
| units       | int  |

- This table may contain duplicate rows.
- Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold.

âœ¨ **Problem:**

Find the **average selling price** for each product:

- Round `average_price` to **2 decimal places**.
- If a product has **no sold units**, its average price should be **0**.

ðŸ”Ž **Example Input:**

**Prices Table:**

| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price |
|------------|------------|------------|-------|
| 1          | 2019-02-17  | 2019-02-28 | 5     |
| 1          | 2019-03-01  | 2019-03-22 | 20    |
| 2          | 2019-02-01  | 2019-02-20 | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-21  | 2019-03-31 | 30    |

**UnitsSold Table:**

| product_id | purchase_date | units |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| 1          | 2019-02-25     | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01     | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10     | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22     | 30    |

ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Output:**

| product_id | average_price |
|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |

âœ… **Calculation Explanation:**

For **product 1**:
- (100 Ã— 5) + (15 Ã— 20) = 500 + 300 = 800
- Total units = 100 + 15 = 115
- Average price = 800 / 115 â‰ˆ **6.96**

For **product 2**:
- (200 Ã— 15) + (30 Ã— 30) = 3000 + 900 = 3900
- Total units = 200 + 30 = 230
- Average price = 3900 / 230 â‰ˆ **16.96**

## ðŸ§  **SQL Solution:**

```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    ROUND(
        COALESCE(SUM(price * units), 0) * 1.0 / COALESCE(SUM(units), 1), 
        2
    ) AS average_price
FROM 
    Prices p
LEFT JOIN 
    UnitsSold u
ON 
    p.product_id = u.product_id 
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY 
    p.product_id
;
```

ðŸ”µ **Key points:**
- **LEFT JOIN** to ensure we include products even if there are no sales.
- **`purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date`** to match the correct price at the time of sale.
- **COALESCE** to handle cases with no sales properly.
- **`ROUND(..., 2)`** for rounding.

# 🏷️ Alias in SQL

An **Alias** in SQL provides a temporary alternative name for a table or column, improving readability and simplifying complex queries.

### ✏️ Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```
or
```sql
SELECT column_name alias_name
FROM table_name;
```
(Note: `AS` is optional.)

### 📋 Example:
```sql
SELECT EmployeeName AS "Employee Name", 
       Department AS "Department Name"
FROM Employees;
```
In this example:
- `EmployeeName` is temporarily displayed as **Employee Name**
- `Department` is shown as **Department Name**

# 🛡️ Default Constraint in SQL

A **Default Constraint** automatically assigns a specified default value to a column when no explicit value is provided during an `INSERT` operation.

### ✏️ Syntax:
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype DEFAULT default_value
);
```

### 📋 Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
    JoinDate DATE DEFAULT GETDATE()
);
```
- Here, if no `JoinDate` is provided during an `INSERT`, SQL Server will automatically use the current date (`GETDATE()`).

# 🌟 Advantages of Using Default Constraint

| Icon | Advantage | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🔄 | **Data Consistency** | Ensures columns always have a meaningful default value if none is explicitly provided, maintaining consistent data across records. |
| ✍️ | **Simplified Data Entry** | Reduces manual work during data insertion; users don't need to enter every value explicitly. |
| 🧹 | **Improved Data Integrity** | Helps avoid unintended NULL values, strengthening the trustworthiness and reliability of the dataset. |
| ⚙️ | **Reduced Application Complexity** | Moves responsibility for defaulting values to the database, simplifying the application code. |

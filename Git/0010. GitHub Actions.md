### ⚙️ What is **GitHub Actions**?

**GitHub Actions** is a **CI/CD automation tool** built into GitHub.
It allows you to **automate workflows** like building, testing, and deploying your code whenever you:

* Push code
* Open a pull request
* Create a release
* Or even on a schedule

### 🧱 Key Components of GitHub Actions

| Component    | Description                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Workflow** | The full automation process (e.g., test + deploy)                  |
| **Job**      | A section of a workflow (e.g., test job, deploy job)               |
| **Step**     | A single task within a job (e.g., run `pytest`)                    |
| **Action**   | Reusable packages (official or custom) that perform specific tasks |
| **Runner**   | The virtual machine that runs the job (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows)      |

### 📄 Sample GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)

```yaml
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run Tests
      run: |
        pytest tests/

    - name: Lint Code
      run: |
        pip install flake8
        flake8 .
```

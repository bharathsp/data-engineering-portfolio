## ⚔️ 1. **Conflict Resolution**

### ✅ What is a Merge Conflict?

A **merge conflict** occurs when **Git cannot automatically decide** how to merge changes between branches — usually because the same line in a file was edited in both branches.

---

### 📌 Example Scenario:

You're on a `feature/model-tuning` branch and want to merge `dev` into it:

```bash
git checkout feature/model-tuning
git merge dev
```

If both branches changed `train_model.py` on the same line, you’ll see:

```
Auto-merging train_model.py
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in train_model.py
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

---

### 🛠️ How to Resolve Merge Conflicts:

1. **Open the conflicting file**. You’ll see:

```python
def train_model():
<<<<<<< HEAD
    lr = 0.01
=======
    lr = 0.001  # more stable
>>>>>>> dev
```

2. **Edit to keep the correct version**:

```python
def train_model():
    lr = 0.001  # Final choice
```

3. **Add and commit the resolved file**:

```bash
git add train_model.py
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between feature/model-tuning and dev"
```

## 🔁 2. **Rebasing**

### ✅ What is Rebase?

`git rebase` **reapplies commits from your branch on top of another branch** (often `main` or `dev`) to produce a cleaner, linear history.

### 📊 Merge vs Rebase

| Action       | History Style | Keeps context? | Easier to read? |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| `git merge`  | Tree-like     | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No            |
| `git rebase` | Linear        | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes           |

---

### 📌 Example: Rebase Your Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout feature/data-cleaning
git rebase dev
```

* Git will apply your commits on top of the current `dev` branch.
* If conflicts occur, Git will stop and ask you to resolve them.

---

### 🛠️ How to Resolve Rebase Conflicts:

1. Resolve the conflict (like before).
2. Mark the file as resolved:

```bash
git add filename
```

3. Continue the rebase:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

4. If you want to abort:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

---

### ⚠️ **Important Notes about Rebase**

* Use **rebase only on local branches** (never rebase a shared branch like `main`).
* **Never rebase public/shared history** — it rewrites commits.

| Topic               | Purpose                                       | Command                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Conflict Resolution | Resolve changes Git can’t merge automatically | Edit file → `git add` → `git commit` |
| Rebase              | Replay commits for a clean linear history     | `git rebase <branch>`                |
| Abort Rebase        | Cancel ongoing rebase                         | `git rebase --abort`                 |
| Continue Rebase     | After fixing conflicts                        | `git rebase --continue`              |

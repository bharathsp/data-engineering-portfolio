## 🔁 **What is a Pull Request (PR) / Merge Request (MR)?**

A **Pull Request (PR)** (in GitHub) or **Merge Request (MR)** (in GitLab/Bitbucket) is a **formal request to merge code** from one branch into another — usually from a `feature` branch into `dev` or `main`.

🧠 It's the **core step in team collaboration**, where others **review, comment, approve, and test** changes before merging them into the main codebase.

## 📂 **Workflow Example**

1. **You create a new branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/data-cleaning
   ```

2. **Work on your changes**:

   ```bash
   # modify files
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added data cleaning pipeline"
   ```

3. **Push your branch to remote**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/data-cleaning
   ```

4. **Create a PR/MR on GitHub or GitLab**:

   * Base branch: `dev` (or `main`)
   * Compare branch: `feature/data-cleaning`
   * Add title + description of changes
   * Tag reviewers (teammates)
   * Link issues (if relevant)

5. **Team reviews the code**:

   * Leave comments
   * Suggest changes
   * Approve (once satisfied)

6. **Merge the PR** (once approved and tests pass)

## ✅ Best Practices

* **Descriptive titles**: "Add pipeline for null value imputation"
* **Small PRs/MRs**: Easier to review and less error-prone
* **Always review others' PRs**: Promote team quality and learning
* **Use draft PRs** when your code is not ready but you want early feedback
* Enable **branch protection** (e.g., block merge without approval or passing tests)

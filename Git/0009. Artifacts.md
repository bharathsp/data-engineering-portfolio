### 📦 What are **Artifacts** in CI/CD?

**Artifacts** are the **output files** or **products** generated during the CI/CD pipeline that are useful for the next stages of development, testing, or deployment.

### 🧩 **In simple terms:**

> **Artifacts = Anything your pipeline builds, tests, or needs to keep.**

### ✅ **Examples of Artifacts**

| Stage | Artifact Example                               |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Build | Compiled binaries (`.exe`, `.jar`, `.whl`)     |
| Test  | Test reports, logs, screenshots                |
| ML    | Trained model files (`model.pkl`, `model.h5`)  |
| Lint  | Code quality reports                           |
| Docs  | Generated documentation (`index.html`, `.pdf`) |

### 🧰 **Why are Artifacts Important?**

* 📤 Used for **deployment** (e.g., uploading a trained model)
* 🔁 Help with **debugging** (e.g., logs of failed tests)
* 🧪 Enable **test reproducibility**
* 📥 Can be **downloaded** and reused across pipeline jobs or by team members

### ‚òÅÔ∏è What is a Cloud Data Catalog?

A **cloud data catalog** is a data catalog hosted and operated on cloud platforms such as **AWS, Azure, or GCP**. It offers the same features as a traditional data catalog but is **scalable, managed, and integrated with cloud-native tools**.

#### üîß Common Cloud Data Catalog Platforms:

* **Google Cloud Data Catalog** (now part of **Dataplex**)
* **AWS Glue Data Catalog**
* **Azure Purview** (now part of **Microsoft Purview**)

#### ‚úÖ Cloud-Specific Benefits:

* **Auto-scaling** and **serverless** architecture
* **Integration** with cloud storage (e.g., S3, BigQuery, Azure Data Lake)
* **Automated metadata harvesting** from cloud services
* **Tag-based access control and governance**
* **Supports multi-region and multi-tenant architecture**

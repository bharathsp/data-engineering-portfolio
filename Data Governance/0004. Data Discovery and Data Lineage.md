## 🔍 What is **Data Discovery**?

**Data Discovery** is the process of **finding, understanding, and exploring data assets** across an organization.

### ✅ Key Goals:

* Help users **find** the right data quickly
* Understand **what the data represents**
* Assess **data quality and relevance**
* Enable **self-service analytics**

### 🧰 Features of Data Discovery Tools:

* **Search & filter** across data assets (tables, files, APIs, etc.)
* **Metadata visibility** (column names, types, descriptions)
* **Data profiling** (null count, min/max, patterns)
* **Business glossary** (explains business terms)
* **Access control integration** (so users only see what they are authorized to)

### 📈 Example:

You're looking for “customer churn data.” A data discovery tool lets you search across your data lake and returns a few tables with descriptions, sample rows, owner information, and quality metrics so you can decide which one to use.

## 🔗 What is **Data Lineage**?

**Data Lineage** is the process of **tracking the flow of data** from its origin to its final destination.

### ✅ Why It’s Important:

* Understand **where data came from**
* Track **how it was transformed**
* Audit **who accessed or changed it**
* Support **debugging and impact analysis**
* Ensure **regulatory compliance** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)

### 📊 Types of Lineage:

* **Source-to-target lineage**: Shows data movement (e.g., from a CSV to a dashboard)
* **Column-level lineage**: Tracks transformations at the field level (e.g., `Total = Price × Quantity`)
* **Cross-system lineage**: Tracks across multiple tools (ETL, warehouse, BI)

### 🔧 Example:

A report shows an incorrect sales total. Data lineage lets you trace back:

1. The **source system** (e.g., Salesforce)
2. The **ETL job** that cleaned/aggregated it
3. The **data warehouse** where it’s stored
4. The **BI dashboard** where it’s displayed

### 🚀 In Cloud Environments:

Modern cloud tools like **Azure Purview**, **AWS Glue**, and **Google Dataplex** offer **automated data discovery and lineage tracking**. They:

* Auto-scan cloud storage, databases, and pipelines
* Generate **interactive lineage graphs**
* Show who accessed what and when
* Help with **governance and compliance**

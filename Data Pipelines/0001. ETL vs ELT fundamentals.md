## ðŸ”¹ **Fundamentals of ETL vs ELT**

| Aspect                           | ETL (Extract â†’ Transform â†’ Load)                                                                                    | ELT (Extract â†’ Load â†’ Transform)                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**                   | Data is first extracted from source systems, transformed in an external engine, then loaded into the data warehouse | Data is extracted and loaded into the target system first, then transformed using the target systemâ€™s compute power |
| **Where transformation happens** | Outside the target system (ETL tool or staging server)                                                              | Inside the target system (e.g., DWH/Cloud DB)                                                                       |
| **Best suited for**              | Traditional data warehouses (e.g., Oracle, Teradata)                                                                | Cloud-native data platforms (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery)                                                             |
| **Performance**                  | May be slower for large datasets; limited by external engine                                                        | High performance for large data; uses DWH scalability                                                               |
| **Complexity**                   | Complex to manage due to intermediate storage and transformation                                                    | Simpler pipelines with fewer tools in the stack                                                                     |
| **Cost implication**             | Compute cost is external to data warehouse                                                                          | Compute cost is inside data warehouse (pay-per-use)                                                                 |
| **Tools commonly used**          | Talend, Informatica, Apache NiFi, AWS Glue                                                                          | dbt, Fivetran, Stitch, Snowflake SQL, BigQuery                                                                      |

## ðŸ”¹ **When to Use ETL vs ELT â€“ Use Cases**

### âœ… **ETL â€“ When to Use**

| Scenario                                | Why                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Legacy on-prem systems                  | ETL fits well with older DWHs like Oracle or Teradata              |
| Sensitive data that needs preprocessing | PII masking, validation outside the warehouse                      |
| Complex business rules                  | Easier to manage in dedicated ETL tools with custom code           |
| Low-latency real-time data pipelines    | When transformation is required before loading to reporting system |

**Example 1**:

> A retail company uses Informatica to extract customer and transaction data from its POS systems, applies transformations (joins, deduplication, aggregations), and loads the clean data into an Oracle data warehouse for reporting.

**Example 2**:

> A financial firm processes and validates transactions using Apache Spark before loading them into a reporting database for compliance.

### âœ… **ELT â€“ When to Use**

| Scenario                                                      | Why                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Working with cloud DWHs (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) | These systems are designed to perform transformation at scale            |
| Data Lakehouse architecture                                   | Load raw data first, transform later using SQL or tools like dbt         |
| Agile/modern analytics workflows                              | Fast prototyping, versioning, modularity using SQL-based transformations |
| Cost optimization & scalability                               | Use DWHâ€™s pay-as-you-go compute only when needed                         |

**Example 1**:

> A media company extracts ad impression and user data via APIs, loads them directly into Snowflake using Fivetran, and then runs transformation jobs in dbt to create dashboards in Looker.

**Example 2**:

> A startup collects raw event logs into BigQuery, then transforms them using scheduled SQL queries to build data marts and customer analytics views.

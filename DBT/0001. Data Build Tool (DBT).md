**dbt (Data Build Tool)** is an **open-source transformation framework** that helps data teams **transform raw data into clean, tested, and documented datasets** inside a data warehouse or lakehouse.

Think of dbt as the **"T" in ELT** (Extract → Load → Transform).

* **Extract & Load (E + L):** Tools like **Fivetran, Airbyte, Informatica, ADF** handle moving raw data into the warehouse.
* **Transform (T):** dbt takes over **inside the warehouse** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks, etc.) and turns that raw data into analytics-ready tables/views.

# ⚡ What is dbt used for?

✅ **1. SQL-based Data Transformations**

* You write transformations in **SQL + Jinja templates**.
* dbt compiles them into SQL queries and runs them inside your warehouse.
* Example: Clean, join, aggregate raw sales data into a `customer_metrics` table.

✅ **2. Modular & Reusable Data Models**

* Organize transformations as **models (SQL files)**.
* Use **ref()** to link models → dbt builds a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of dependencies.
* Helps manage complex pipelines cleanly.

✅ **3. Data Testing & Quality**

* You can define **tests** (e.g., unique keys, non-null checks, referential integrity).
* dbt validates data as part of the transformation pipeline.

✅ **4. Documentation & Lineage**

* Auto-generates **docs & lineage graphs** showing how datasets are built.
* Useful for debugging & governance.

✅ **5. Version Control & CI/CD**

* dbt projects live in **Git** → enabling code reviews, branching, and CI/CD for data pipelines.
* Fits well with modern **DataOps** practices.

# 🔹 Where dbt Fits in the Modern Data Stack

* **Raw Data → (Fivetran/Airbyte/ADF) → Warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift/Databricks) → dbt → BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker)**

So, **dbt bridges the gap between data ingestion and BI dashboards** by ensuring data is clean, transformed, and trustworthy.

# 🛠️ Common Use Cases of dbt

1. **Building Data Marts** – e.g., sales, finance, marketing-ready datasets.
2. **Data Quality Checks** – ensure valid business metrics.
3. **Analytics Engineering** – empowering analysts to build transformations in SQL without deep engineering overhead.
4. **Data Lineage & Governance** – track how KPIs are derived.
5. **CI/CD for Data** – testing changes before they impact dashboards.

---

📌 **In short:**
dbt = **SQL + Git + Testing + Documentation** → a powerful framework to **transform and govern analytics data inside warehouses**.

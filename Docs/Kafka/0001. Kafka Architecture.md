Apache Kafka is a **distributed event streaming platform** designed for **high-throughput**, **fault-tolerant**, and **real-time data processing**. It is used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming apps.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Kafka Architecture Overview

Here's a high-level view of the components and flow in Kafka architecture:

```
+------------+        +------------+       +-----------+
|  Producer  | -----> |   Kafka    | ----> | Consumer  |
| (Publisher)|        |  Cluster   |       | (Subscriber)|
+------------+        +------------+       +-----------+
                            |
                            V
                     +-------------+
                     |  Topic (log)|
                     +-------------+
                            |
                     +-------------+
                     | Partitions  |
                     +-------------+
                            |
                     +-------------+
                     |  Brokers     |
                     +-------------+
                            |
                     +-------------+
                     | Zookeeper    | (deprecated, optional)
                     +-------------+
```

## üîç Core Kafka Components

### 1. **Producer**

* Sends (publishes) messages to Kafka topics.
* Can choose which partition to send messages to (e.g., based on a key).
* **Asynchronous** and **high-throughput**.

### 2. **Topic**

* A **category/feed name** to which messages are published.
* Think of it like a "folder" that holds ordered logs of messages.
* Topics are **split into partitions**.

### 3. **Partition**

* A topic is divided into one or more partitions.
* Messages within a partition are **ordered**.
* Each partition is replicated across multiple **brokers** for fault tolerance.

### 4. **Broker**

* A Kafka server that stores data and serves clients.
* Handles partitions; each broker may host multiple partitions.
* Kafka cluster is made up of multiple brokers.

### 5. **Consumer**

* Subscribes to one or more topics.
* Consumes messages in **order** within a partition.
* Kafka supports **consumer groups** for parallel consumption and scaling.

### 6. **Consumer Group**

* A group of consumers where each partition is read by only one consumer in the group.
* Enables horizontal scaling of message processing.

### 7. **Zookeeper** (being phased out with KRaft mode)

* Maintains metadata, cluster configuration, and leader election.
* Required for Kafka versions < 2.8.0.

## üîÑ Kafka Data Flow

1. **Producers** send messages to a **Kafka topic**.
2. The topic is split into multiple **partitions**.
3. **Brokers** store the messages and manage partition logs.
4. **Consumers** pull messages from specific **partitions**.
5. Consumers track their read progress via **offsets**.
6. Offsets can be **automatically or manually committed**.

---

## üí° Example Flow

* Suppose you have a topic called `"orders"` with 3 partitions.
* Producer A sends order data to Kafka.
* Kafka assigns each message to one of the 3 partitions.
* Consumers in a consumer group process orders:

  * Consumer 1 ‚Üí Partition 0
  * Consumer 2 ‚Üí Partition 1
  * Consumer 3 ‚Üí Partition 2

## ‚ö° Kafka Key Features

* **High Throughput** ‚Äì Handles millions of messages/sec.
* **Durability** ‚Äì Stores data on disk with replication.
* **Scalability** ‚Äì Add brokers to scale horizontally.
* **Fault Tolerance** ‚Äì Handles broker or consumer failures.
* **Replayability** ‚Äì Rewind to any offset and reprocess.

### ✅ What are Kafka Topics?

A **Kafka Topic** is a **logical channel or category** where producers send data and consumers read from.
Think of it like a **folder** in which all related messages (events) are stored.

* Topics are **append-only logs**.
* Each topic is split into **partitions**.
* Kafka retains messages in a topic for a configured period (even after they are consumed).

### 📦 Real-Life Example of Kafka Topics

**Scenario: Banking System**

A bank might have these Kafka topics:

| Kafka Topic               | Data Published By              | Consumed By                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `transaction-events`      | ATM, Mobile App, Branch System | Fraud Detection, Ledger Services |
| `customer-signups`        | Mobile App, Website            | CRM System, Welcome Email Engine |
| `loan-application-events` | Loan Portal                    | Underwriting Service, Risk Model |

Each topic separates different types of events, allowing independent scaling and processing.

### 🧑‍💻 How to Create Kafka Topics

#### ✅ Option 1: **Auto Topic Creation**

Kafka can auto-create a topic when a producer sends data to a **non-existent topic**.

> 🔴 Not recommended for production. You lose control over partitioning and replication.

---

#### ✅ Option 2: **Manual Topic Creation using CLI**

##### 📌 Step-by-step using terminal

```bash
# Create a topic named 'transaction-events' with 3 partitions and replication factor 1
kafka-topics.sh --create \
  --topic transaction-events \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --partitions 3 \
  --replication-factor 1
```

**Flags:**

* `--topic`: Name of the topic
* `--partitions`: Number of partitions (affects parallelism)
* `--replication-factor`: Fault tolerance
* `--bootstrap-server`: Address of Kafka broker

---

### 🔍 View All Topics

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

---

### 🧑‍💻 Create Kafka Topic Using Python (AdminClient)

```python
from confluent_kafka.admin import AdminClient, NewTopic

# Connect to Kafka broker
admin_client = AdminClient({
    "bootstrap.servers": "localhost:9092"
})

# Define a new topic
topic = NewTopic("transaction-events", num_partitions=3, replication_factor=1)

# Create topic
fs = admin_client.create_topics([topic])

# Wait for result
for topic, f in fs.items():
    try:
        f.result()
        print(f"Topic '{topic}' created successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to create topic {topic}: {e}")
```

---

### 🧾 Output

```
Topic 'transaction-events' created successfully
```

### 🛠️ Best Practices for Kafka Topics

* Choose **partition count** wisely for scalability.
* Set **retention policies** (e.g., keep 7 days of data).
* Avoid too many small topics; it increases overhead.
* Enable **compaction** for changelog-style topics (e.g., user profile updates).

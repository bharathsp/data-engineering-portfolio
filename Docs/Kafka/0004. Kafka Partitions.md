### ✅ What are Kafka **Partitions**?

In Apache Kafka, a **partition** is a **subdivision of a topic**.
Each topic can have **one or more partitions**, which enables:

* **Parallelism** (more consumers can process in parallel)
* **Scalability** (distributes data across brokers)
* **Ordering guarantee per partition**

---

### 📌 Think of It Like:

A topic is a **book**, and each partition is a **chapter**. Messages (events) go into these chapters (partitions), and consumers read one chapter at a time.

---

### 📦 Real-Life Example of Kafka Partitions

#### Use Case: **Ride-hailing App (like Uber)**

Topic: `ride-events`
Each ride event (start, stop, payment) is sent to this topic.

Kafka partitions:

* Partition 0: Events from drivers in Bangalore
* Partition 1: Events from drivers in Delhi
* Partition 2: Events from drivers in Mumbai

This setup:

* Allows **parallel processing** by city.
* Maintains **order of events** for each driver if keyed by driver\_id.
* Scales easily as traffic grows.

### 🔄 Benefits of Partitions

| Feature         | How Partitions Help                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Scalability     | More partitions = More parallelism            |
| Fault Tolerance | Each partition can be replicated              |
| Ordering        | Kafka guarantees order **within** a partition |
| Load Balancing  | Messages are distributed across partitions    |

### 🛠️ Creating a Topic with Partitions (CLI)

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --create \
  --topic ride-events \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --partitions 3 \
  --replication-factor 1
```

This creates a topic `ride-events` with **3 partitions**.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Creating a Topic with Partitions Using Python

Using `confluent-kafka`'s `AdminClient`:

```python
from confluent_kafka.admin import AdminClient, NewTopic

# Kafka Admin client config
admin_client = AdminClient({
    "bootstrap.servers": "localhost:9092"
})

# Create a topic with 3 partitions
topic = NewTopic("ride-events", num_partitions=3, replication_factor=1)

# Create topic
future = admin_client.create_topics([topic])

# Check if creation succeeded
for topic, f in future.items():
    try:
        f.result()
        print(f"Topic '{topic}' created with 3 partitions")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to create topic '{topic}': {e}")
```

---

### 🧑‍🔬 How Kafka Chooses Partitions (Partitioning Strategy)

1. **No Key Provided** → Round-robin across partitions
2. **Key Provided** → Hash(key) determines partition
   (e.g., same `driver_id` always maps to the same partition)

```python
producer.produce(
    topic="ride-events",
    key="driver123",  # ensures order for this driver
    value=json.dumps(ride_event)
)
```

---

### 🛑 Important Notes

* You **cannot decrease** the number of partitions once a topic is created.
* You **can increase** partitions, but it may affect message order.

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --alter \
  --topic ride-events \
  --partitions 5 \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

### **`-v` / `--volume`**
* Mounts a **host directory or volume** into the container.

```bash
docker run -v /host/data:/container/data nginx
```
This mounts (or links) a folder from your **host machine** (your laptop or server) into the **container's file system**.
### ðŸ”¹ Syntax

```
-v <host_path>:<container_path>
```

* `/host/data` â†’ Directory on your **host** (your real machine)
* `/container/data` â†’ Directory **inside the container**

### ðŸ”¹ What Happens Here?

ðŸ“Œ Any files created or modified in `/container/data` inside the container are actually stored in `/host/data` on your local machine â€” **and vice versa**.

Itâ€™s like giving the container access to a shared folder.

### ðŸ”¹ Why Is This Useful?

#### âœ… **1. Data Persistence**

* By default, Docker containers are **ephemeral** â€” when you stop or remove them, the data inside is gone.
* With volumes, you **keep your data safe on the host** even after the container is removed.

#### âœ… **2. Development Workflow**

* You can mount your code folder (from your laptop) into a container:

  ```bash
  docker run -v $(pwd):/app my-python-app
  ```
* Now any change you make in your local code is immediately available inside the container.

#### âœ… **3. Database Storage**

* For example, with MySQL:

  ```bash
  docker run -v /my/host/db:/var/lib/mysql mysql
  ```
* All database files persist in `/my/host/db` on your system.

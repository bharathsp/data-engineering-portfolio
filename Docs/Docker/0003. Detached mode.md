### **`-d` / `--detach`**
**Detached mode** in Docker is a way to run a container in the background instead of keeping it attached to your terminal session. This allows you to continue using your terminal while the container runs.

When you run a container using:

```bash
docker run -d <image_name>
```
The `-d` (or `--detach`) flag tells Docker to start the container **in the background** and **return the container ID** instead of attaching the terminal to the container's output.
### ðŸ”¹ Why Use Detached Mode?
* You want the container to run continuously (e.g., web servers, databases).
* You donâ€™t want to monitor the container logs in real-time.
* You want to run multiple containers in parallel from the same terminal.
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```
* Runs the Nginx web server in detached mode.
* `-p 80:80` maps port 80 on your machine to port 80 in the container.
* Youâ€™ll get a container ID as output, and the container keeps running in the background.

### ðŸ”¹ How to Check and Manage a Detached Container?

* **List containers:**

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

* **Stop a container:**

  ```bash
  docker stop <container_id>
  ```

* **View logs of a detached container:**

  ```bash
  docker logs <container_id>
  ```

* **Reattach to a detached container (if needed):**

  ```bash
  docker attach <container_id>
  ```

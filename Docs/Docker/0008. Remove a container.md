### **`--rm`**

### 🔹 What Does `--rm` Do?

```bash
docker run --rm ubuntu echo "Hello"
```

The `--rm` flag tells Docker to:

> 🧹 **Automatically delete (remove) the container once it stops.**

---

### 🔹 Without `--rm`:

* The container **still exists** in a "stopped" state after it runs.
* You can see it with:

  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```
* It takes up disk space and clutters your container list.

---

### 🔹 With `--rm`:

* As soon as the container completes its task (like printing `Hello`), Docker:

  * **Stops it**
  * **Deletes it immediately**
* Nothing is left behind — no container ID, no data, no cleanup needed.

---

### 🔹 Example

```bash
docker run --rm ubuntu echo "Hello"
```

* Docker pulls the `ubuntu` image (if not already present).
* Runs the command `echo "Hello"` inside the container.
* You see:

  ```
  Hello
  ```
* Then the container is **automatically removed**.

---

### 🔹 When Should You Use `--rm`?

✅ Use it when:

* You're running short-lived, one-time commands (e.g., testing something).
* You don't need to **inspect** or **reuse** the container afterward.
* You want to avoid **manually cleaning up** stopped containers.

❌ Don’t use it if:

* You want to **debug** or **check logs** after it runs.
* You need **persistent data** stored in the container.

| With `--rm`               | Without `--rm`                   |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Container is auto-deleted | Container stays in stopped state |
| No manual cleanup         | Requires `docker rm` later       |

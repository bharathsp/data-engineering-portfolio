# Structured Query Language

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful language used to interact with, manage, and manipulate data in relational databases.

## Basic Structure of a SQL Query
<pre>
  SELECT column1, column2 
  FROM table_name 
  WHERE condition 
  GROUP BY column1
  ORDER BY column1 DESC;
</pre>

### Order of Writing a SQL Query:

1. **SELECT**: Specifies the columns to be retrieved.  
2. **FROM**: Specifies the table to retrieve the data from.  
3. **WHERE**: Filters the rows based on a condition.  
4. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows sharing a property so that aggregate functions can be applied.  
5. **HAVING**: Filters groups based on a condition.  
6. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set.

## Order of Query Execution:

### 1. **FROM**  
- **Purpose**: Determine the source tables.  
- **Explanation**: The query starts by identifying the tables from which the data will be retrieved.  
- **Example**:  
  If we have a table called `employees`, the `FROM` clause tells SQL to look in the `employees` table for the data.
  <pre>
    FROM employees
  </pre>

### 2. **WHERE**  
- **Purpose**: Filter the rows based on conditions.  
- **Explanation**: After identifying the table, SQL filters the rows based on the specified conditions.  
- **Example**:  
  If you only want employees from the `employees` table who work in the `'Sales'` department, you would use a `WHERE` clause.
  <pre>
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = 'Sales';
  </pre>

### 3. **GROUP BY**  
- **Purpose**: Group the rows that have the same values in specified columns.  
- **Explanation**: Useful for aggregation.  
- **Example**:  
  To count the number of employees in each department.
  <pre>
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM employees
    WHERE department IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY department;
  </pre>

### 4. **HAVING**  
- **Purpose**: Filter groups based on conditions.  
- **Explanation**: The `HAVING` clause filters groups created by the `GROUP BY` clause based on specified conditions.  
- **Example**:  
  To find departments with more than 10 employees.
  <pre>
    SELECT department
    FROM employees
    WHERE department IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY department
    HAVING COUNT(*)>10;
  </pre>

### 5. **SELECT**  
- **Purpose**: Retrieve the specified columns.  
- **Explanation**: Specifies which columns of data to retrieve.  
- **Example**:  
  To select the department names and the count of employees in each department.
  <pre>
    SELECT department, count(*)
    FROM employees
    WHERE department IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY department
    HAVING COUNT(*)>10;
  </pre>

### 6. **ORDER BY**  
- **Purpose**: Sort the final result set.  
- **Explanation**: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.  
- **Example**:  
  To sort departments by the number of employees in descending order.
  <pre>
    SELECT department, count(*)
    FROM employees
    WHERE department IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY department
    HAVING COUNT(*)>10
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
  </pre>

## Real-life Applications of SQL

- **Business Intelligence**: Retrieve, update, and manipulate data to generate reports.
- **Inventory Tracking**: Manage product stock levels and sales.
- **CRM Systems**: Manage customer data and track interactions.
- **Financial Transactions**: Perform and track complex financial operations.
- **Data Analysis**: Analysts and data scientists extract meaningful insights from large datasets.
- **Web Development**: Handle user data like login credentials, user profiles, and transactions.

SQL's ability to efficiently handle and query data makes it indispensable in fields such as:

- **Finance**
- **Healthcare**
- **Retail**
- **Technology**

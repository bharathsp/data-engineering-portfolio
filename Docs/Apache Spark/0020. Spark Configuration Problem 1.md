## You have two wide transformation and one action in a spark job, and handling 2 GB data. 
## How many spark jobs will be launched?
## How many stages will be there in each of the spark job?
## How many tasks will be there in each of the job?

### 🔁 Spark Concepts Recap

* **Transformation**: Operation on RDD/DataFrame returning a new RDD/DataFrame.

  * **Narrow Transformation**: e.g., `map`, `filter` — no shuffling.
  * **Wide Transformation**: e.g., `groupBy`, `reduceByKey`, `join` — causes shuffling.

* **Action**: Triggers actual execution, e.g., `count()`, `collect()`, `saveAsTextFile()`.

* **Job**: One action triggers one job.

* **Stage**: Each job is split into stages based on shuffling — a wide transformation typically leads to a stage boundary.

* **Task**: A unit of execution per partition in each stage.

### 🧠 Given:

* **2 wide transformations**
* **1 action**
* **Handling 2 GB data**

---

### 💡 Expected Breakdown:

#### ✅ **Jobs**:

* **1 Action** ⇒ **1 Job**

#### ✅ **Stages**:

* Each **wide transformation** introduces a **shuffle**, thus creating **stage boundaries**.
* Typically:

  * Stage 1: Before 1st shuffle
  * Stage 2: After 1st shuffle, before 2nd
  * Stage 3: After 2nd shuffle
* ➤ So: **2 wide transformations = 3 stages**

#### ✅ **Tasks**:

* Number of tasks = number of partitions per stage.
* By default, Spark partitions data based on HDFS block size or configuration (default \~128 MB).
* So for 2 GB of data:

  ```
  2 GB / 128 MB = 16 partitions ⇒ ~16 tasks per stage (assuming default)
  ```

### ✅ **Final Answer**:

| Metric     | Value                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Jobs**   | 1                                 |
| **Stages** | 3                                 |
| **Tasks**  | \~16 per stage (× 3) = \~48 total |

*Note*: Number of tasks can vary based on `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` (default = 200 in Spark SQL) or `sc.defaultParallelism` in RDD.

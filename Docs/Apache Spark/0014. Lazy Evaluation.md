## üí§ What is **Lazy Evaluation** in Spark?

In Apache Spark, **Lazy Evaluation** means that **Spark does not execute transformations immediately** when they are called. Instead, it **builds a logical execution plan (DAG)** and **executes only when an action is triggered** (like `count()`, `collect()`, `save()`, etc.).

This allows Spark to **optimize the execution plan** before actually running any code.

---

## üîÑ What Happens During Lazy Evaluation?

1. Spark records transformations like `map()`, `filter()`, `groupBy()` in a **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**.
2. **No actual computation happens** until an action (e.g., `count()`, `show()`, `saveAsTextFile()`) is called.
3. Spark **optimizes the DAG**, combines transformations into stages, and then executes them **efficiently and in parallel**.

---

## ‚úÖ When to Use Lazy Evaluation?

Lazy evaluation is **default in Spark**, so it‚Äôs **always in effect**. You benefit from it automatically when:

* You apply **multiple transformations** before triggering an action.
* You want Spark to **optimize the execution plan**.
* You‚Äôre using **wide transformations** (e.g., `join`, `groupBy`) that benefit from DAG optimization.

## ‚ùå When Lazy Evaluation Can Be Problematic?

| ‚ùå Considerations                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- |
| Debugging becomes harder (errors show up late). |
| Long transformation chains delay feedback.      |
| You must use **actions** to trigger execution.  |

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages of Lazy Evaluation

* üß† **Optimization**: Spark analyzes all transformations before execution.
* üíæ **Avoids unnecessary computation**.
* ‚ö° **Combines narrow transformations** to minimize I/O and shuffle.
* üöÄ **Faster execution**, especially for long transformation chains.

---

## ‚ùå Disadvantages of Lazy Evaluation

* üêõ **Late error detection** (e.g., syntax or schema errors show only on action).
* üß™ Can confuse new users expecting immediate results after each transformation.

## üîç Example Without Lazy Evaluation (Hypothetical)

```python
# Hypothetical (not how Spark actually behaves)
df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df_filtered = df.filter(df["age"] > 25)  # Would run immediately in eager mode
df_mapped = df_filtered.select("name", "age")  # Another computation
df_mapped.show()  # Action
```

This would **run 3 times** in an eager system.

---

## ‚úÖ Actual Lazy Evaluation in Spark

```python
df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# These transformations are just recorded
df_filtered = df.filter(df["age"] > 25)
df_mapped = df_filtered.select("name", "age")

# Nothing runs until an action
df_mapped.show()
```

‚úÖ Spark runs **all steps at once**, after creating an optimized execution plan.

---

## üß™ Performance Example ‚Äî Without vs With Lazy Evaluation

### ‚ùå Simulating Eager (inefficient):

```python
df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Suppose you force action after every transformation (not recommended)
df1 = df.filter("age > 25")
df1.count()  # Forces execution (not needed)

df2 = df1.select("name", "age")
df2.count()  # Again forces execution
```

> ‚ùå Spark runs multiple jobs, not optimized.

---

### ‚úÖ Efficient Lazy Evaluation

```python
df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Chain transformations
df_final = df.filter("age > 25").select("name", "age")

# Single action ‚Äî executes optimized plan
df_final.show()
```

> ‚úÖ Spark combines filter and select into one stage ‚Äî **faster and efficient**.

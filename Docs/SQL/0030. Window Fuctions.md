### ‚úÖ What are **Window Functions** in SQL?

**Window functions** perform calculations across a set of table rows that are **somehow related to the current row**. Unlike aggregate functions (like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`), window functions do **not group rows into a single output row**‚Äîthey return a value for **each row** in the result set.

---

### üîç **Why Use Window Functions?**

They are used when:

* You want **aggregated values** (like running totals, ranks, moving averages) **without collapsing rows**.
* You need **row-wise comparison** within a partition (group).
* You want to do advanced analytics like **ranking**, **percentiles**, or **lag/lead comparisons**.

---

### üîß **Syntax**

```sql
function_name(column) OVER (
  PARTITION BY column1
  ORDER BY column2
  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
```

---

### üí° Common **Window Functions**

| Function              | Description                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ROW_NUMBER()`        | Assigns a unique number to rows per group |
| `RANK()`              | Ranks rows; same rank for ties            |
| `DENSE_RANK()`        | Like `RANK` but no gaps after ties        |
| `LAG()` / `LEAD()`    | Get value of a previous/next row          |
| `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc | Aggregations over a window                |

---

We‚Äôll use the following **sample table `Employees`**:

| EmpID | Name    | Department | Salary | JoiningDate |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1     | Alice   | HR         | 60000  | 2020-01-15  |
| 2     | Bob     | HR         | 55000  | 2021-06-10  |
| 3     | Charlie | IT         | 70000  | 2019-03-01  |
| 4     | David   | IT         | 70000  | 2020-07-25  |
| 5     | Eva     | IT         | 65000  | 2021-01-12  |

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ `RANK()` vs `DENSE_RANK()`

```sql
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DenseRank
FROM Employees;
```

### üßæ Output:

| Name    | Dept | Salary | Rank | DenseRank |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | ---- | --------- |
| Alice   | HR   | 60000  | 1    | 1         |
| Bob     | HR   | 55000  | 2    | 2         |
| Charlie | IT   | 70000  | 1    | 1         |
| David   | IT   | 70000  | 1    | 1         |
| Eva     | IT   | 65000  | 3    | 2         |

### üìò Explanation:

* `RANK()` skips numbers if there's a tie.
* `DENSE_RANK()` gives consecutive ranks even if there's a tie.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ `ROW_NUMBER()`

```sql
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNum
FROM Employees;
```

### üßæ Output:

| Name    | Dept | Salary | RowNum |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| Alice   | HR   | 60000  | 1      |
| Bob     | HR   | 55000  | 2      |
| Charlie | IT   | 70000  | 1      |
| David   | IT   | 70000  | 2      |
| Eva     | IT   | 65000  | 3      |

### üìò Explanation:

* Assigns **unique numbers** to each row **per partition**, even with duplicates.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ `LAG()` and `LEAD()`

```sql
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
  LAG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS PrevSalary,
  LEAD(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS NextSalary
FROM Employees;
```

### üßæ Output:

| Name    | Dept | Salary | PrevSalary | NextSalary |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Alice   | HR   | 60000  | NULL       | 55000      |
| Bob     | HR   | 55000  | 60000      | NULL       |
| Charlie | IT   | 70000  | NULL       | 70000      |
| David   | IT   | 70000  | 70000      | 65000      |
| Eva     | IT   | 65000  | 70000      | NULL       |

### üìò Explanation:

* `LAG()` returns the **previous row's** value.
* `LEAD()` returns the **next row's** value.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ `SUM() OVER`, `AVG() OVER`, `COUNT() OVER`

```sql
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
  SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department) AS DeptTotal,
  AVG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department) AS DeptAvg,

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ `NTILE(n)`

```sql
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
  NTILE(2) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS SalaryGroup
FROM Employees;
```

### üßæ Output (divides each department into 2 equal groups):

| Name    | Dept | Salary | SalaryGroup |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| Alice   | HR   | 60000  | 1           |
| Bob     | HR   | 55000  | 2           |
| Charlie | IT   | 70000  | 1           |
| David   | IT   | 70000  | 1           |
| Eva     | IT   | 65000  | 2           |

### üìò Explanation:

* Splits rows **into `n` equal buckets** ordered by specified column.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ `PERCENT_RANK()`

```sql
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
  PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS PercentRank
FROM Employees;
```

### üßæ Output:

| Name    | Dept | Salary | PercentRank |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| Alice   | HR   | 60000  | 0.0         |
| Bob     | HR   | 55000  | 1.0         |
| Charlie | IT   | 70000  | 0.0         |
| David   | IT   | 70000  | 0.0         |
| Eva     | IT   | 65000  | 1.0         |

### üìò Explanation:

* Returns the **relative rank** of a row:
  $(rank - 1) / (total rows - 1)$

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ `FIRST_VALUE()` and `LAST_VALUE()`

```sql
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
  FIRST_VALUE(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS TopSalary,
  LAST_VALUE(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS BottomSalary
FROM Employees;
```

### üßæ Output:

| Name    | Dept | Salary | TopSalary | BottomSalary |
| ------- | ---- | ------ | --------- | ------------ |
| Alice   | HR   | 60000  | 60000     | 55000        |
| Bob     | HR   | 55000  | 60000     | 55000        |

| David   | IT   | 70000  | 70000     | 65000        |
| Eva     | IT   | 65000  | 70000     | 65000        |

### üìò Explanation:

* `FIRST_VALUE()` returns the **first row** value in the window.
* `LAST_VALUE()` returns the **last row** value (be cautious‚Äîuse full window frame).

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ `NTH_VALUE()`

```sql
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
  NTH_VALUE(Salary, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS SecondHighest
FROM Employees;
```

### üßæ Output:

| ------- | ---- | ------ | ------------- |
| Alice   | HR   | 60000  | 55000         |
| Bob     | HR   | 55000  | 55000         |
| Charlie | IT   | 70000  | 70000         |
| David   | IT   | 70000  | 70000         |
| Eva     | IT   | 65000  | 70000         |

### üìò Explanation:

* Returns the **n-th value** in an ordered window.
* Needs frame clause to avoid wrong results.

---

### üöÄ When Should You Use Them?

Use window functions when you:

* Need **row-level calculations** with context (like previous values).
* Want **summary statistics** per group **without reducing row count**.
* Are building **reports, dashboards**, or **analytics pipelines**.

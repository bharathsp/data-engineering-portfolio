### 🔍 SQL `LIKE` Operator

The `LIKE` operator in SQL is used to **filter results based on specified patterns**, allowing for partial matches within string columns.

---

### 🔧 **Syntax**

Two wildcards are commonly used with the `LIKE` operator:

- **`%` (Percent Sign)**  
  ➤ Represents zero, one, or multiple characters.  
  ➤ Used to match any sequence of characters.

- **`_` (Underscore)**  
  ➤ Represents a **single character**.  
  ➤ Used to match characters at specific positions.

### 📊 Example Table: `Employees`

| EmployeeID | Name     | Email                |
|------------|----------|----------------------|
| 101        | Alice    | alice@domain.com     |
| 102        | Aaron    | aaron@company.com    |
| 103        | Anand    | anand@domain.com     |
| 104        | Bob      | bob@domain.com       |

### ✅ Using the `%` Wildcard

#### 🔹 Example 1: Names that start with 'A'

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE 'A%';
```

📌 **Result**: Returns employees with names like `Alice`, `Aaron`, `Anand`.

---

#### 🔹 Example 2: Emails ending with '@domain.com'

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Email LIKE '%@domain.com';
```

📌 **Result**: Returns emails like `alice@domain.com`, `anand@domain.com`, `bob@domain.com`.

---

### ✅ Using the `_` Wildcard

#### 🔹 Example: Names starting with 'A' and exactly 5 characters long

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE 'A____';
```

📌 **Result**: Matches names like `Alice` (5-letter name starting with 'A').

---

### 🔁 Combining `%` and `_` Wildcards

#### 🔹 Example: Names with 'a' as the second character

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE '_a%';
```

📌 **Result**: Matches names like `Aaron`.

### 🧠 Summary

| Wildcard | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `%`      | Matches zero or more characters       |
| `_`      | Matches exactly one character         |

Understanding how to use `LIKE` with `%` and `_` wildcards gives you **powerful tools** for flexible and partial string matching in SQL.

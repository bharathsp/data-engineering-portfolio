# 🛠️ SQL Stored Procedures

A **Stored Procedure** is a **precompiled set of SQL statements** that can be executed as a single unit to perform a specific task.

> 🎯 **Analogy**: Imagine a stored procedure as a recipe you've written once — instead of rewriting it every time you cook, you reuse it. Similarly, you write the SQL logic once, save it, and call it whenever needed.

## 📘 Syntax: Creating a Stored Procedure

### 🧱 Basic Syntax
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcedureName
AS
BEGIN
   -- SQL statements
END;
```

---

## 📘 Syntax: With Parameters

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE ProcedureName
   @param1 datatype,
   @param2 datatype
AS
BEGIN
   -- SQL logic using parameters
END;
```

---

## ▶️ Executing a Stored Procedure

### 🔹 Without Parameters
```sql
EXEC ProcedureName;
```

### 🔹 With Parameters
```sql
EXEC ProcedureName @param1 = value1, @param2 = value2;
```

---

## 🔄 Modifying a Stored Procedure

```sql
ALTER PROCEDURE ProcedureName
AS
BEGIN
   -- Modified SQL logic
END;
```

---

## ❌ Dropping a Stored Procedure

```sql
DROP PROCEDURE ProcedureName;
```

## 📋 Sample Table: `Employees`

| id | name    | department | salary |
|----|---------|------------|--------|
| 1  | Alice   | HR         | 50000  |
| 2  | Bob     | IT         | 60000  |
| 3  | Charlie | IT         | 58000  |
| 4  | Diana   | Finance    | 55000  |

## 🧪 Example: Increase Salary by Percentage

> 🎯 Goal: Create a stored procedure that **increases the salary** of employees in a specific department by a given percentage.

### ✅ SQL Code:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE IncreaseSalaryByDept
   @Department NVARCHAR(50),
   @IncreasePercentage FLOAT
AS
BEGIN
   UPDATE Employees
   SET salary = salary + (salary * @IncreasePercentage / 100)
   WHERE department = @Department;

   SELECT * FROM Employees
   WHERE department = @Department;
END;
```

---

## ▶️ Executing the Stored Procedure

> 💼 Increase salary of IT employees by 10%:

```sql
EXEC IncreaseSalaryByDept @Department = 'IT', @IncreasePercentage = 10;
```

### 📊 Result (after execution):

| id | name    | department | salary |
|----|---------|------------|--------|
| 2  | Bob     | IT         | 66000  |
| 3  | Charlie | IT         | 63800  |

## ✅ Benefits of Stored Procedures

### 🔁 Reusability
Write once, use many times across different applications.

### 🚀 Performance
Stored procedures are **precompiled** and **cached**, leading to faster execution.

### 🔐 Security
Limit direct access to tables. Let users interact through procedures only.

### 🛠️ Maintainability
Centralized business logic makes updating procedures easier.

---

## ⚠️ Best Practices

- Always include **error handling** (`TRY...CATCH`) in complex procedures.
- Use **parameterized procedures** to avoid SQL injection.
- Document the purpose and parameters of the procedure using comments.

## 🧠 Final Thought

> **Stored Procedures** simplify repetitive operations, improve security, and optimize performance by encapsulating logic at the database level. Whether you're managing payroll, filtering reports, or applying data transformations, stored procedures are an essential tool for any SQL developer.

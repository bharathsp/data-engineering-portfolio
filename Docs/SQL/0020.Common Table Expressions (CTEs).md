# 📘 Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL

A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** is a **temporary result set** defined using the `WITH` clause. It improves the readability and maintainability of complex SQL queries.

---

## 🧱 Syntax

```sql
WITH CTE_Name AS (
   -- SQL Query
)
SELECT * FROM CTE_Name;
```

You can use CTEs with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements.

## ✅ Single CTE Example

Let's say we have an `Employees` table:

| id | name   | department | salary |
|----|--------|------------|--------|
| 1  | Alice  | HR         | 50000  |
| 2  | Bob    | IT         | 60000  |
| 3  | Carol  | IT         | 70000  |
| 4  | Diana  | HR         | 52000  |
| 5  | Ethan  | Finance    | 58000  |

### 💡 CTE to Calculate Average Salary per Department

```sql
WITH AvgSalary AS (
   SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY department
)
SELECT * FROM AvgSalary;
```

### 📊 Output:

| department | avg_salary |
|------------|------------|
| HR         | 51000.0    |
| IT         | 65000.0    |
| Finance    | 58000.0    |

## 🔁 Multiple CTE Example

### 🧮 Total & Average Salary per Department

```sql
WITH TotalSalary AS (
   SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY department
),
AvgSalary AS (
   SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY department
)
SELECT t.department, t.total_salary, a.avg_salary
FROM TotalSalary t
JOIN AvgSalary a ON t.department = a.department;
```

### 📊 Output:

| department | total_salary | avg_salary |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| HR         | 102000       | 51000.0    |
| IT         | 130000       | 65000.0    |
| Finance    | 58000        | 58000.0    |

## 🔄 Recursive CTE Example (Organizational Hierarchy)

### 🧾 `CompanyHierarchy` Table

| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 1           | Sarah          | NULL       |
| 2           | Robert         | 1          |
| 3           | Kevin          | 2          |
| 4           | Emily          | 2          |
| 5           | Michael        | 3          |
| 6           | Rachel         | 4          |

---

### 🎯 Objective: List employees and their levels in the hierarchy

```sql
WITH OrgCTE AS (
   -- Anchor member
   SELECT employee_id, employee_name, manager_id, 1 AS Level
   FROM CompanyHierarchy
   WHERE manager_id IS NULL

   UNION ALL

   -- Recursive member
   SELECT ch.employee_id, ch.employee_name, ch.manager_id, Level + 1
   FROM CompanyHierarchy ch
   INNER JOIN OrgCTE o ON ch.manager_id = o.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM OrgCTE;
```

### 📊 Output:

| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id | level |
|-------------|----------------|------------|-------|
| 1           | Sarah          | NULL       | 1     |
| 2           | Robert         | 1          | 2     |
| 3           | Kevin          | 2          | 3     |
| 4           | Emily          | 2          | 3     |
| 5           | Michael        | 3          | 4     |
| 6           | Rachel         | 4          | 4     |

## 🎯 Benefits of Using CTEs

### ✅ Readability & Maintenance
Break complex queries into modular, logical blocks.

### 🔁 Reusability
Reference a CTE multiple times within the same query.

### 🔄 Recursive Queries
Handle hierarchical/tree-like data structures efficiently.

### 📦 Encapsulation
Avoid clutter by encapsulating subqueries.

## 🧠 Final Thought

> CTEs are a powerful way to write cleaner, more manageable SQL. Whether you're doing aggregation, joins, or recursion — CTEs let you modularize and simplify your logic without creating temporary tables.

## 🔄 Transaction Control Language (TCL) in SQL

Transaction Control Language is a set of SQL commands used to manage transactions in a database, including committing, rolling back, and setting transaction properties.

### 🧾 List of TCL Commands:

#### 💾 COMMIT
**Description:**  
Saves (commits) the changes made during the current transaction to the database.

**Syntax:**
```sql
COMMIT;
```

**Example:**
```sql
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE account_id = 101;

COMMIT;
```
*Commits the updates made to the `accounts` table, making the changes permanent.*

---

#### 🔁 ROLLBACK
**Description:**  
Rolls back (undoes) the changes made during the current transaction, restoring the database to its state before the transaction began.

**Syntax:**
```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

**Example:**
```sql
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE account_id = 101;

ROLLBACK;
```
*Undoes the updates made to the `accounts` table, canceling the transaction and reverting to the previous state.*

---

#### 🪙 SAVEPOINT
**Description:**  
Sets a named point in a transaction to which you can later roll back.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name;
```

**Example:**
```sql
SAVEPOINT before_second_update;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 50
WHERE account_id = 102;

ROLLBACK TO before_second_update;
```
*Sets a savepoint `before_second_update` after the first update and rolls back to that savepoint if needed.*

### 🧠 Summary
Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands — `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT` — are essential for managing transactions within a database. These commands allow users to:
- Ensure data integrity
- Recover from errors
- Manage complex operations effectively

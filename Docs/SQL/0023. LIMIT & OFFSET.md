## 📄 LIMIT & OFFSET in SQL  

#### 🔢 `LIMIT`  
Specifies the **maximum number of rows** the query should return.

#### ⏭️ `OFFSET`  
Specifies **how many rows to skip** before starting to return results.

### 📚 Real-Life Analogy:

> 📘 Imagine you have a stack of 100 books:  
> - `LIMIT 10` is like saying, “Show me the **first 10 books**.”  
> - `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10` is like saying, “Skip the first 10, and show me the **next 10**.”

Perfect for breaking large datasets into manageable pieces — especially for **pagination**!

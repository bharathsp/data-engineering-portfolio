# 📊 SQL `GROUP BY` Clause

The `GROUP BY` clause in SQL is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns. It’s typically used with **aggregate functions** like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, etc., to return summarized results.

## 🔧 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1;
```

---

## 📘 Explanation

- ✅ **SELECT**: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve.
- 📈 **aggregate_function()**: Performs a calculation on a group of values and returns a single value (e.g., `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`).
- 🗂️ **FROM**: Indicates the table you're querying.
- 🔍 **WHERE** *(optional)*: Filters rows before grouping.
- 📦 **GROUP BY**: Groups the result set by one or more columns.

## 📦 Example

Suppose we have a table named `orders`:

| order_id | customer_id | amount |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1        | C001        | 100    |
| 2        | C002        | 200    |
| 3        | C001        | 150    |
| 4        | C003        | 300    |
| 5        | C002        | 250    |

**Query**: Find the total amount spent by each customer:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Result**:

| customer_id | total_spent |
|-------------|-------------|
| C001        | 250         |
| C002        | 450         |
| C003        | 300         |

### 📘 `ORDER BY` Clause in SQL

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to **sort the result set** of a SQL query based on one or more columns.

---

### 🧾 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC | DESC], column2 [ASC | DESC], ...;
```

---

### 🧠 Explanation

- 🔹 **`SELECT`**: Specifies the columns to retrieve from the table.  
- 🔹 **`FROM`**: Indicates the table from which to fetch the data.  
- 🔹 **`ORDER BY`**: Determines the sort order of the result set.  
  - 🔼 By default, sorts in **ascending order (`ASC`)**
  - 🔽 Use **`DESC`** to sort in descending order

### 📌 Example 1: Order by Single Column

Suppose we have a `students` table:

| student_id | name     | score |
|------------|----------|-------|
| 1          | Alice    | 87    |
| 2          | Bob      | 92    |
| 3          | Charlie  | 78    |

#### 🔍 Query:  
Get student names and scores sorted by score in **descending** order:

```sql
SELECT name, score
FROM students
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

#### 📊 Result:

| name    | score |
|---------|-------|
| Bob     | 92    |
| Alice   | 87    |
| Charlie | 78    |

### 📌 Example 2: Order by Multiple Columns

Suppose we have an `employees` table:

| emp_id | name    | department | salary |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|
| 1      | Alice   | HR         | 60000  |
| 2      | Bob     | IT         | 75000  |
| 3      | Charlie | IT         | 72000  |
| 4      | Diana   | HR         | 65000  |

#### 🔍 Query:  
Order employees by `department` in ascending order, and `salary` in descending order within each department:

```sql
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;
```

#### 📊 Result:

| name    | department | salary |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Diana   | HR         | 65000  |
| Alice   | HR         | 60000  |
| Bob     | IT         | 75000  |
| Charlie | IT         | 72000  |

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- Use `ORDER BY` to control **presentation and analysis** of query results.
- Default sort order is **ascending (`ASC`)**.
- Use **`DESC`** to reverse the order.
- You can sort by **multiple columns**.

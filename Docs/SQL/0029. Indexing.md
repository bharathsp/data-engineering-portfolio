# 💾 ACID Properties in SQL

# 🔍 What is a Transaction?

- A **transaction** is a **single logical unit of work** that **accesses** and **modifies** data in a database.
- Transactions involve **read** and **write** operations.
- To **maintain database consistency** before and after a transaction, databases follow **ACID properties**.

# 🧪 What are ACID Properties?

**ACID** stands for:

| Icon | Property | Meaning |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ⚛️ | **Atomicity** | Ensures that **all parts of a transaction** are completed successfully, or **none** are. It is "all-or-nothing". |
| 🧹 | **Consistency** | Guarantees that a transaction **takes the database from one valid state to another**, maintaining all predefined rules, like constraints and triggers. |
| 🧍 | **Isolation** | Ensures that **concurrent transactions** do not affect each other. Each transaction appears to run **independently**. |
| 🛡️ | **Durability** | Once a transaction is committed, the changes are **permanently saved**, even if the system crashes afterward. |

---

# ✨ In Simple Words:

- **Atomicity** → "All steps succeed or none do."
- **Consistency** → "Database remains valid before and after the transaction."
- **Isolation** → "Transactions don't interfere with each other."
- **Durability** → "Once saved, always saved."

# 📋 Example to Understand ACID:

Imagine a **bank transfer**:
- You transfer ₹5000 from Account A to Account B.
-  
  | Step | Action | ACID Property |
  |:---|:---|:---|
  | 1 | Deduct ₹5000 from Account A | Atomicity |
  | 2 | Add ₹5000 to Account B | Atomicity |
  | 3 | Ensure no money is lost in between | Consistency |
  | 4 | Let other transfers happen simultaneously without conflict | Isolation |
  | 5 | Even if a power failure happens, ensure transaction is recorded | Durability |

# 🎯 Why are ACID Properties Important?

- 🚀 **Ensure data reliability**
- 🔒 **Prevent data corruption**
- 🤝 **Maintain trust and correctness in multi-user environments**
- ⚙️ **Enable safe concurrent access**

# 🔗 SQL Joins

A **JOIN** is a SQL operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

---

## 🧩 Types of Joins

- 🔸 `INNER JOIN`
- 🔹 `LEFT JOIN` (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`)
- 🔸 `RIGHT JOIN` (or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`)
- 🔹 `FULL JOIN` (or `FULL OUTER JOIN`)
- 🔁 `SELF JOIN`

---

## 🔸 INNER JOIN

### 📘 Definition
Returns only the rows with **matching values in both tables**.

### 🧪 Syntax
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

> ✅ When you use `JOIN` without specifying the type, SQL performs an `INNER JOIN` by default.

### 🧾 Example

**students**
| student_id | name   |
|------------|--------|
| 1          | Alice  |
| 2          | Bob    |

**courses**
| course_id | student_id | course     |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 101       | 1          | Math       |
| 102       | 2          | Science    |

```sql
SELECT s.name, c.course
FROM students s
INNER JOIN courses c
ON s.student_id = c.student_id;
```

**Result:**
| name   | course     |
|--------|------------|
| Alice  | Math       |
| Bob    | Science    |

## 🔹 LEFT JOIN / LEFT OUTER JOIN

### 📘 Definition
Returns **all rows from the left table** and **matched rows** from the right. If no match, right columns return `NULL`.

### 🧪 Syntax
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### 🧾 Example

```sql
SELECT s.name, c.course
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN courses c
ON s.student_id = c.student_id;
```

➡️ This will include all students, even those not enrolled in any course.

---

## 🔸 RIGHT JOIN / RIGHT OUTER JOIN

### 📘 Definition
Returns **all rows from the right table** and **matched rows** from the left. If no match, left columns return `NULL`.

### 🧪 Syntax
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### 🧾 Example

```sql
SELECT s.name, c.course
FROM students s
RIGHT JOIN courses c
ON s.student_id = c.student_id;
```

➡️ Includes all courses, even if a course has no enrolled student.

---

## 🔹 FULL JOIN / FULL OUTER JOIN

### 📘 Definition
Returns **all rows from both tables**, with `NULL`s where a match doesn't exist.

### 🧪 Syntax
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### 🧾 Example

```sql
SELECT s.name, c.course
FROM students s
FULL JOIN courses c
ON s.student_id = c.student_id;
```

➡️ Shows all students and all courses — matches when possible, `NULL`s otherwise.

---

## 🔁 SELF JOIN

### 📘 Definition
A join where a table is joined with **itself**. Often used for hierarchical data (e.g., employees and managers).

### 🧪 Syntax
```sql
SELECT a.name AS Employee, b.name AS Manager
FROM employees a
JOIN employees b
ON a.manager_id = b.employee_id;
```

### 🧾 Example

**employees**
| employee_id | name     | manager_id |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1           | Alice    | NULL       |
| 2           | Bob      | 1          |
| 3           | Charlie  | 1          |

**Result:**
| Employee | Manager |
|----------|---------|
| Bob      | Alice   |
| Charlie  | Alice   |

## ➕ CROSS JOIN

### 📘 Definition  
A **CROSS JOIN** returns the **Cartesian product** of two tables—every row from the first table is joined with every row from the second.

### 🧪 Syntax
```sql
SELECT a.name, b.department
FROM employees a
CROSS JOIN departments b;
```

### 🧾 Example

**employees**
| name     |
|----------|
| Alice    |
| Bob      |

**departments**
| department |
|------------|
| HR         |
| IT         |

**Result:**
| name  | department |
|-------|------------|
| Alice | HR         |
| Alice | IT         |
| Bob   | HR         |
| Bob   | IT         |

| `INNER JOIN`     | Rows with matches in **both** tables                             |
| `LEFT JOIN`      | All left table rows + matching right table rows                 |
| `RIGHT JOIN`     | All right table rows + matching left table rows                 |
| `FULL JOIN`      | All rows from both tables, matched when possible                |
| `SELF JOIN`      | Join a table to itself                                          |
| `CROSS JOIN`     | Cartesian product (all combinations of rows from both tables)   |

### 🔄 SQL `INTERSECT` Operator

The `INTERSECT` operator in SQL returns **only the rows that are common** between the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements.

---

### 🧪 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
```

> ✅ Both queries **must return the same number of columns**, and the data types must be **compatible**.

---

### 📘 Explanation

- `INTERSECT` performs a **set operation**, returning rows **present in both** result sets.
- Duplicate rows are automatically eliminated (similar to `UNION`).
- It’s often used to find **overlapping records** between tables or queries.

---

### 🎓 Example

Let’s say we have two tables:

**students_2023**
| student_id | name     | course     |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 101        | Alice    | Math       |
| 102        | Bob      | Science    |
| 103        | Charlie  | History    |

**students_2024**
| student_id | name     | course     |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 102        | Bob      | Science    |
| 104        | Diana    | Math       |
| 103        | Charlie  | History    |

---

### 🔍 Query

```sql
SELECT student_id, name, course FROM students_2023
INTERSECT
SELECT student_id, name, course FROM students_2024;
```

---

### 🧾 Result

| student_id | name     | course     |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 102        | Bob      | Science    |
| 103        | Charlie  | History    |

➡️ Only the rows that **exactly match in all columns** from both tables are returned.

---

### ✅ Use Cases

- Finding students/customers present in two different time periods.
- Identifying records that fulfill multiple criteria across different datasets.
- Comparing snapshots of tables to find unchanged rows.

---

### 🚨 Important Notes

- Column names don’t need to match, but **column positions and data types must**.
- `INTERSECT` removes duplicates by default.

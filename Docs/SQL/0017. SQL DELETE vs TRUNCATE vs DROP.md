# 🧹 SQL DELETE vs TRUNCATE vs DROP

Understanding the key differences between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP` is essential for managing database tables effectively.

## 📋 Sample Table: `employees`

| id | name       | department | salary |
|----|------------|------------|--------|
| 1  | Alice      | HR         | 50000  |
| 2  | Bob        | IT         | 60000  |
| 3  | Charlie    | HR         | 52000  |
| 4  | Diana      | Finance    | 55000  |

## 🔸 DELETE

The `DELETE` statement is used to remove **specific rows** from a table based on a **WHERE** clause.

### ✅ Syntax:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### 📌 Example:
```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
```

### 📊 Result:

| id | name    | department | salary |
|----|---------|------------|--------|
| 2  | Bob     | IT         | 60000  |
| 4  | Diana   | Finance    | 55000  |

- Only rows where department = 'HR' are deleted.
- Can be **rolled back** if inside a transaction.
- **Triggers** are fired.
- **Deletes are logged** for each row.

## 🔸 TRUNCATE

The `TRUNCATE` statement is used to **remove all rows** from a table quickly and efficiently.

### ✅ Syntax:
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

### 📌 Example:
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
```

### 📊 Result:
- All rows from `employees` are deleted.
- Table is now empty.
- **Cannot delete specific rows**.
- **Cannot be rolled back** in many databases.
- **No row-level logging**.
- Resets **identity/auto-increment** values.
- **Triggers are not fired**.

---

## 🔸 DROP

The `DROP` statement is used to **remove the entire table**, including all data, structure, constraints, and indexes.

### ✅ Syntax:
```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

### 📌 Example:
```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```

### 📊 Result:
- The `employees` table is completely removed from the database.
- All its data, structure, and metadata are gone.
- Cannot be rolled back.

## 📝 Summary

- **DELETE**: Removes specific rows with conditions. Good for controlled deletions. Supports rollback.
- **TRUNCATE**: Quickly clears all rows. More efficient than DELETE for large datasets. Does not support WHERE.
- **DROP**: Completely removes the table. Use with caution!

**Bitbucket** is a **Git-based** source code management and collaboration platform developed by **Atlassian** (the company behind Jira, Confluence, etc.).
It helps teams **store, manage, review, and deploy code** — all in one place.

🔹 Think of **Bitbucket** as a **cloud-based workspace for Git repositories**, just like GitHub or GitLab, but with tight integration into Atlassian’s ecosystem (especially Jira).

Imagine a **university** 🎓

| In Real Life                                 | In Confluence           |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| University Library                           | Confluence Workspace 📚 |
| Department Section (e.g., Engineering, Arts) | Spaces 🏢               |
| Each Book                                    | A Page 📄               |
| Chapters                                     | Sub-pages 📑            |
| Notes and Comments                           | Inline feedback 💬      |

AWS **Kinesis** is a **real-time data streaming service**.
It allows you to **collect, process, and analyze** large streams of data in real time so that you can get insights and respond quickly.

Think of it like a **pipeline** 🚇 for continuous data flow:

* Data is generated → collected by Kinesis → processed → stored or used by apps.

# 🎯 What is it used for?

* 📡 **Real-time data ingestion** (IoT sensors, clickstreams, social media feeds, app logs).
* ⚡ **Real-time analytics** (fraud detection, anomaly detection, monitoring dashboards).
* 🗄️ **Storing and replaying data streams** for later use.
* 🔗 **Feeding machine learning models** with live data.

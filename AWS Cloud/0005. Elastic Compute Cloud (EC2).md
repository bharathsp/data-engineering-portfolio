🖥️ **What it is**

Amazon EC2 is a **cloud computing service** that provides **resizable virtual servers** (called *instances*) in the AWS cloud.
You can run applications, host websites, process data, or train ML models without buying physical servers.

# 🌍 Real-life Use Case

**Example: Netflix 🎬**
Netflix uses thousands of EC2 instances to stream movies and TV shows to millions of users worldwide.

* When demand spikes (weekends, new releases), EC2 automatically scales up to handle extra traffic.
* When demand drops, EC2 scales down — saving cost.

# 💡 Advantages of EC2

🔧 **Scalability** – Increase or decrease servers instantly.
💰 **Pay-as-you-go** – Pay only for what you use.
🌍 **Global availability** – Deploy servers anywhere.
🛡️ **Secure** – Integrated with AWS security services.
⚡ **Performance flexibility** – Choose from general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, or GPU instances.

# 🔄 Real-Life Analogy

🏢 **Owning a Physical Office Server** vs. 🏠 **Renting a Co-working Space**

* If you buy a physical server → you must buy, maintain, upgrade, and pay for it all the time (even if unused).
* With **EC2 (like WeWork)** → you just rent what you need, when you need it.

  * Need a big space (powerful server) today? 🏗️ You rent it.
  * Tomorrow need a small desk (smaller server)? 🪑 Just scale down.
  * Stop renting anytime to save money.

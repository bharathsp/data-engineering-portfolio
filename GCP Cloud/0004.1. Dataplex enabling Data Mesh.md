## 🔑 Quick Refresher: What is Data Mesh?

Data Mesh = **organizational + technical approach** where data is treated as a **product** owned by domain teams, not centralized in a single data lake/warehouse.
Key principles:

1. **Domain ownership** 🏢
2. **Data as a product** 📦
3. **Self-serve platform** ⚙️
4. **Federated governance** 🛡️

## 🏗️ How Dataplex Enables Data Mesh

### 1. **Domain-oriented Data Lakes/Zones**

* In Dataplex, you create **Lakes** 🌊 for broad domains (Finance, Marketing, Sales, Operations).
* Inside lakes, you create **Zones** 🗂️ (e.g., raw, curated, sandbox).
* Each domain team gets **ownership** of its own lake/zone.

👉 Icon representation:

```
🏦 Finance Lake
   └─ 🗂️ Raw Zone
   └─ 🗂️ Curated Zone

📈 Marketing Lake
   └─ 🗂️ Raw Zone
   └─ 🗂️ Curated Zone
```

---

### 2. **Entities = Data Products**

* Within each zone, data is registered as **Entities** 📊 (tables, files).
* Each entity represents a **data product** the domain owns.
* Teams define **schema, quality, and tags** to describe their products.

👉 Example:

* Finance Lake → Curated Zone → Entity = `customer_transactions` 📦

---

### 3. **Tag Templates = Standardized Metadata**

* Use **Tag Templates** 🏷️ to enforce product metadata standards across all domains.
* Examples:

  * `Data Quality` tag template (freshness, completeness, accuracy)
  * `PII Classification` tag template (sensitive fields, risk level)

👉 Icon view:

```
📊 customer_transactions
   🏷️ Data Quality: High
   🏷️ PII: Yes
```

---

### 4. **Policy Binding = Federated Governance**

* IAM **Policy Bindings** 🔑 let you assign **domain teams** control of their lakes/zones.
* Central governance team sets **guardrails** (policies, classification).
* Domains still control **access to their products**.

👉 Example:

* Finance domain team → `roles/dataplex.admin` on Finance Lake
* Data governance team → `roles/dataplex.viewer` across all lakes

---

### 5. **Self-serve Access & Discovery**

* Dataplex integrates with **Data Catalog** 🔍 so all entities are discoverable.
* Analysts/engineers can search for data products by tags, domains, or quality.
* Consumers get a **data marketplace experience**.

---

### 6. **Monitoring & Lineage**

* Dataplex provides **data profiling, quality checks, and lineage** 🔄.
* Helps ensure data products meet **SLOs** (like freshness, accuracy).

## 🎯 Visual Flow of Data Mesh with Dataplex

```
🏢 Domain Teams own Lakes/Zones
       ↓
📊 Entities registered as Data Products
       ↓
🏷️ Tagged with Templates (quality, PII, domain info)
       ↓
🔑 Access managed with Policy Bindings
       ↓
🔍 Discoverable via Data Catalog
       ↓
📈 Consumers use trusted, governed data products
```

---

✅ **In short**:

* **Lakes/Zones** → represent domains
* **Entities** → represent data products
* **Tag Templates** → enforce governance/standards
* **Policy Bindings** → enable federated governance
* **Catalog & Quality** → enable discovery & trust

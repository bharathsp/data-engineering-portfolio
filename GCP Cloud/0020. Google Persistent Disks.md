# 🚀 What are Google Persistent Disks?

* **Persistent Disk (PD)** is **block storage** for Google Cloud’s **Compute Engine** VMs.
* Works like an **external hard drive** attached to a VM instance.
* Data **persists independently** of the VM lifecycle (even if you stop or delete the VM).
* Can be **zonal** (attached within a zone) or **regional** (replicated across zones for HA).

👉 Think of it as: **“Durable, resizable, high-performance block storage for your Google Cloud VMs.”**

# ⚙️ Types of Persistent Disks

Google offers different PD types depending on performance & cost:

1. **Standard Persistent Disk (pd-standard)**

   * Backed by **HDD**.
   * Low-cost, good for sequential I/O.
   * Best for backups, archival, large but less frequently accessed data.

2. **Balanced Persistent Disk (pd-balanced)**

   * Mid-tier SSD option.
   * Balance between price & performance.
   * Good for web apps, medium-traffic DBs.

3. **SSD Persistent Disk (pd-ssd)**

   * Backed by **SSD**.
   * High IOPS, low latency.
   * Ideal for high-performance transactional workloads.

4. **Extreme Persistent Disk (pd-extreme)**

   * Ultra-high IOPS & throughput.
   * Provision performance separately from capacity.
   * Great for mission-critical DBs (SAP HANA, Oracle, etc.).

# 🎯 What is it used for?

* **VM boot disks** (OS + startup files).
* **Databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SAP HANA).
* **High-performance apps** (e-commerce, financial systems).
* **Big Data processing** (Hadoop/Spark temp storage).
* **Shared read-only data** across multiple VMs.

# ✅ Advantages of Persistent Disks

* 🔒 **Durable & Reliable** → Automatic replication within zone (or across zones if regional).
* 🔄 **Resizable** → Increase capacity without downtime.
* 🔌 **Flexible attachment** → Attach/detach to different VMs.
* 📈 **Performance scaling** → Scales with size (more GB → more IOPS).
* 🛡️ **Snapshots & backups** → Create incremental snapshots anytime.
* 🌍 **Regional PD** → Survives zone failures (HA).

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

* 🔄 Write access → A PD can be **writable only by one VM at a time** (but can be attached read-only to many VMs).
* 📊 Performance linked to disk size (except Extreme PD where you provision IOPS separately).
* 💰 High-performance PDs (SSD, Extreme) can get costly.

# ⚡ In short

* **Persistent Disk = Block storage for Compute Engine.**
* Comes in 4 flavors: **Standard (HDD), Balanced SSD, SSD, Extreme SSD**.
* Great for **databases, VMs, and high-performance workloads**.
* Supports **snapshots, resizing, regional replication**.

# 🚀 What is Google Cloud SQL?

**Google Cloud SQL** is a **fully-managed relational database service** in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

* Managed means Google handles **patching, backups, replication, and failover**.
* You get a **traditional SQL database** without managing servers or storage.
* Supports popular database engines:

  * **MySQL** 🐬
  * **PostgreSQL** 🐘
  * **SQL Server** 🗄️

Think of it like:
➡️ “I want a relational database in the cloud, fully managed, that just works.”

# ☁️ 1. **Block Storage**

📦 **What it is:**

* Data stored in fixed-size blocks.
* Each block acts like a **hard drive partition** → raw storage.
* High performance, low latency.
* Often used by databases, VM disks, transactional workloads.

⚙️ **Google Cloud Service:**

* **Persistent Disk (PD)** → Block storage for **Compute Engine** VMs.
* **Hyperdisk** (next-gen block storage) → For workloads needing very high IOPS.

✅ **Use cases:**

* Running databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
* VM boot disks.
* High-performance transactional apps.

# 📂 2. **File Storage**

📁 **What it is:**

* Data stored as files in a **hierarchical directory structure**.
* Multiple machines can share the same file system.
* Supports POSIX-compliant file operations (`read`, `write`, `chmod`).

⚙️ **Google Cloud Service:**

* **Filestore** → Managed **NFS (Network File System)** service.
* Can be mounted by multiple **Compute Engine VMs** or **GKE clusters**.

✅ **Use cases:**

* Content management systems.
* Shared file systems for apps (like SAP, media rendering).
* Machine learning model training with shared datasets.

---

# 🗂️ 3. **Object Storage**

🪣 **What it is:**

* Data stored as **objects** → each object = data + metadata + unique ID.
* Flat namespace (not a folder tree, though you can simulate folders).
* Highly scalable, cost-effective, great for unstructured data.

⚙️ **Google Cloud Service:**

* **Cloud Storage (GCS)** → Object storage with buckets.

  * Classes: Standard, Nearline, Coldline, Archive (based on access frequency).

✅ **Use cases:**

* Backup & archiving.
* Media storage (images, videos, PDFs).
* Big Data & ML (storing raw datasets, logs).
* Website hosting (static content).

# 🔄 Visual Mnemonic

```
📦 Block Storage (Persistent Disk / Hyperdisk)
   → Acts like a hard drive for a VM (fast, transactional)

📂 File Storage (Filestore)
   → Acts like a shared folder (NFS, collaborative)

🪣 Object Storage (Cloud Storage)
   → Acts like an infinite bucket (scalable, unstructured data)
```

---

👉 **Rule of Thumb:**

* If you need **raw disk-like storage** → use **Block**.
* If you need **shared folder/file system** → use **File**.
* If you need **scalable storage for any type of object** → use **Object**.

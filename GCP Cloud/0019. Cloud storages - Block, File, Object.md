# ☁️ 1. **Block Storage**

📦 **What it is:**

* Data stored in fixed-size blocks.
* Each block acts like a **hard drive partition** → raw storage.
* High performance, low latency.
* Often used by databases, VM disks, transactional workloads.

⚙️ **Google Cloud Service:**

* **Persistent Disk (PD)** → Block storage for **Compute Engine** VMs.
* **Hyperdisk** (next-gen block storage) → For workloads needing very high IOPS.

✅ **Use cases:**

* Running databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
* VM boot disks.
* High-performance transactional apps.

# 📂 2. **File Storage**

📁 **What it is:**

* Data stored as files in a **hierarchical directory structure**.
* Multiple machines can share the same file system.
* Supports POSIX-compliant file operations (`read`, `write`, `chmod`).

⚙️ **Google Cloud Service:**

* **Filestore** → Managed **NFS (Network File System)** service.
* Can be mounted by multiple **Compute Engine VMs** or **GKE clusters**.

✅ **Use cases:**

* Content management systems.
* Shared file systems for apps (like SAP, media rendering).
* Machine learning model training with shared datasets.

# 🗂️ 3. **Object Storage**

🪣 **What it is:**

* Data stored as **objects** → each object = data + metadata + unique ID.
* Flat namespace (not a folder tree, though you can simulate folders).
* Highly scalable, cost-effective, great for unstructured data.

⚙️ **Google Cloud Service:**

* **Cloud Storage (GCS)** → Object storage with buckets.

  * Classes: Standard, Nearline, Coldline, Archive (based on access frequency).

✅ **Use cases:**

* Backup & archiving.
* Media storage (images, videos, PDFs).
* Big Data & ML (storing raw datasets, logs).
* Website hosting (static content).

# ⚡ In short:

* **Block (Persistent Disk, Hyperdisk)** → Fast, structured storage for apps & DBs.
* **File (Filestore)** → Shared file system for multiple VMs/containers.
* **Object (Cloud Storage)** → Scalable, cost-effective storage for unstructured data.

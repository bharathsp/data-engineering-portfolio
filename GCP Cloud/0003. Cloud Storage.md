### ‚òÅÔ∏è Key Features of GCP Cloud Storage:

| Feature                    | Description                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Object Storage**         | Stores data as objects in **buckets**, not files in folders like traditional file systems. |
| **Durability**             | 99.999999999% (11 9s) durability using redundancy and replication.                         |
| **Scalability**            | No limit on the amount of data you can store.                                              |
| **Global Accessibility**   | Access data from anywhere using HTTP(S) or client libraries.                               |
| **Security**               | Integration with **IAM**, **VPC Service Controls**, **encryption at rest and in transit**. |
| **Lifecycle Management**   | Automatically move or delete objects based on age or conditions.                           |
| **Multi-Regional Support** | Store data in multiple regions for low-latency access.                                     |

### üß± Components

1. **Buckets**

   * Logical containers for storing objects.
   * You specify storage class, location, and permissions at the bucket level.

2. **Objects**

   * Data files (like images, videos, CSVs, etc.) along with metadata.
   * Stored inside buckets.

### üßä Storage Classes

| Storage Class | Use Case                        | Availability | Cost     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| **Standard**  | Frequently accessed data        | High         | Higher   |
| **Nearline**  | Accessed once a month           | Medium       | Lower    |
| **Coldline**  | Accessed once a quarter         | Low          | Cheaper  |
| **Archive**   | Rarely accessed (e.g., backups) | Very Low     | Cheapest |

---

### üßæ Example Use Cases

* Hosting static website assets like HTML, JS, images
* Storing log files and analytics data
* Backup and disaster recovery
* Serving machine learning model files
* Data lake for BigQuery or Dataproc

---

### üõ† Example: Uploading File via `gsutil` (CLI)

```bash
gsutil cp myfile.csv gs://my-bucket-name/
```

---

### üîê Security

* Integrated with **Google IAM** to control who can access buckets and objects.
* Data is **encrypted at rest and in transit**.
* Supports **Object Versioning**, **Retention Policies**, and **Audit Logs**.

### üÜö Comparison with File Systems

| Feature       | Cloud Storage (GCS)      | Traditional File System |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Data Type     | Objects (blobs)          | Files                   |
| Hierarchy     | Flat (simulated folders) | Hierarchical            |
| Access Method | REST APIs, CLI, SDKs     | POSIX/NTFS File Paths   |

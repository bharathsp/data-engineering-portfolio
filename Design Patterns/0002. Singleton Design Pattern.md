# 🔹 Singleton Design Pattern

### 📌 Definition

Singleton is a **creational design pattern** that ensures:

* Only **one instance** of a class exists.
* Provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

---

# 🔹 Why & When to Use It

✅ Use when:

* You need **exactly one object** to coordinate actions across the system.
* The instance is **costly to create** and must be reused.
* Shared resource needs controlled access (e.g., database connection, logging system).

🚫 Avoid when:

* Multiple independent instances are required.
* Global state introduces hidden dependencies (can make testing harder).

# 🔹 Real-life Analogy

🏛 **Government** → A country can only have **one president/prime minister** at a time.

📞 **Phonebook** → One global contact directory everyone refers to.

🖥 **Printer spooler** → Manages all print jobs; if there were multiple, it’d be chaos.

# 🔹 Python Code Example

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None  # 🔒 class-level variable to store single instance

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance


# Example usage
s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()

print(s1 is s2)  # ✅ True → both refer to the same instance
```

---

# 🔹 Advantages

✨ **Controlled access** → Only one instance exists.
✨ **Saves memory** → Avoids creating multiple objects.
✨ **Consistent state** → Shared resource is centralized.
✨ **Thread safety** (if implemented properly).

# 🏗️ **Key Data Engineering Design Patterns**
In data engineering, design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in building data pipelines, data lakes, and analytics systems. Think of them like “best practice blueprints.”

## 1. **Lambda Architecture** 🔺

* **Idea**: Combine **batch** + **real-time** pipelines.
* **Layers**:

  * Batch (e.g., Spark, Hive) → accurate but slow.
  * Speed (e.g., Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming) → fast but approximate.
  * Serving → combines both for query.
* **Use case**: Fraud detection, recommendation engines.
* **Analogy**: Having both a **ledger (batch)** and a **live cash register (streaming)** for financial records.

---

## 2. **Kappa Architecture** 🔄

* **Idea**: Simplified **stream-only architecture**.
* All data (real-time + replays) flows through a **streaming pipeline**.
* **Use case**: IoT sensor data, log analytics.
* **Analogy**: Instead of keeping both “ledger” and “cash register,” you only maintain **one continuous record**.

---

## 3. **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** 🏅 (popular in Databricks)

* **Bronze**: Raw ingested data.
* **Silver**: Cleaned & structured.
* **Gold**: Aggregated, business-ready data.
* **Use case**: Enterprise data lakehouses.
* **Analogy**: Turning raw sugarcane (Bronze) → refined sugar (Silver) → packaged sweets (Gold).

---

## 4. **Event-Driven Architecture** ⚡

* **Idea**: Data is triggered and processed **based on events** (not batch schedules).
* Tools: Kafka, Pub/Sub, EventBridge.
* **Use case**: Real-time notifications, microservices integration.
* **Analogy**: A **doorbell** — action happens immediately when pressed (event).

---

## 5. **ETL vs ELT** 🛠️

* **ETL (Extract → Transform → Load)**: Transform before loading into warehouse.
* **ELT (Extract → Load → Transform)**: Load raw data into warehouse/lake, transform later.
* **Use case**:

  * ETL = legacy pipelines, compliance-heavy.
  * ELT = cloud warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks).
* **Analogy**:

  * ETL = Wash & cut fruits **before storing in fridge**.
  * ELT = Store fruits raw, **prepare when needed**.

---

## 6. **Data Mesh** 🌐

* **Idea**: Decentralized ownership → teams own their **domain data products**.
* Enforced via governance (e.g., Dataplex, Unity Catalog).
* **Use case**: Large enterprises with many teams/domains.
* **Analogy**: Instead of one giant kitchen, each family in an apartment complex cooks and manages its own food, but follows hygiene rules.

---

## 7. **Data Fabric** 🧵

* **Idea**: Unified **governance, catalog, and security layer** across distributed data sources.
* **Use case**: Multi-cloud, hybrid organizations.
* **Analogy**: A **city metro card** that works across all bus/train systems.

---

## 8. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** 📑

* **Idea**: Separate read and write data flows.
* Writes → event store; Reads → query-optimized store.
* **Use case**: E-commerce, banking systems.
* **Analogy**: Having one **counter for deposits** and another **for withdrawals** in a bank.

---

## 9. **Change Data Capture (CDC)** 🔄

* **Idea**: Capture row-level changes from source systems (inserts/updates/deletes).
* Tools: Debezium, Fivetran, GoldenGate.
* **Use case**: Sync transactional DB → data warehouse.
* **Analogy**: Instead of copying entire book daily, just note the **edits on each page**.

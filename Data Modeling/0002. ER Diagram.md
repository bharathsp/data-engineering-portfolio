### 📘 What is an ER Diagram?

An **ER Diagram (Entity-Relationship Diagram)** is a **visual representation of data and their relationships** in a database system. It helps **design a logical structure** before implementing a database, ensuring that the data is organized efficiently.

Originally proposed by **Peter Chen** in 1976, ER diagrams are widely used in **database design**, especially for **relational databases**.

---

### 📊 Purpose of ER Diagrams

* To model **real-world entities** and how they relate to each other
* To communicate database structure clearly between business and technical teams
* To serve as a **blueprint** for creating tables, constraints, and keys in a relational database

### 🔹 Components of an ER Diagram

| Component                 | Symbol                            | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity**                | Rectangle 🟥                      | A real-world object or concept (e.g., Student, Course)                     |
| **Attribute**             | Ellipse ⭕                         | A property of an entity (e.g., Name, Age)                                  |
| **Primary Key**           | Underlined attribute              | Uniquely identifies an entity (e.g., StudentID)                            |
| **Composite Attribute**   | Ellipse connected to sub-ellipses | Attribute made up of smaller parts (e.g., FullName = FirstName + LastName) |
| **Multivalued Attribute** | Double ellipse ⭕⭕                 | An attribute that can have multiple values (e.g., PhoneNumbers)            |
| **Derived Attribute**     | Dashed ellipse                    | Attribute derived from another (e.g., Age from DOB)                        |
| **Relationship**          | Diamond 🔷                        | How two entities are related (e.g., Enrolls, Owns)                         |
| **Cardinality**           | Notation (1:1, 1\:N, M\:N)        | Defines how many instances of one entity relate to another                 |

---

### 🔹 Example

**Entities**:

* `Student(StudentID, Name, Email)`
* `Course(CourseID, Title)`

**Relationship**:

* `Enrolls(StudentID ↔ CourseID)`
  → Many students can enroll in many courses (**M\:N relationship**)

---

### 🔹 Cardinality Types

| Type                    | Example                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One-to-One (1:1)**    | Each person has one passport                                |
| **One-to-Many (1\:N)**  | One teacher teaches many classes                            |
| **Many-to-Many (M\:N)** | Students enroll in many courses, courses have many students |

### 1. **One**

🔹 **Example**:
A **person** has **one birth certificate**.

🗂️ Relationship:
`Person (1) — (1) Birth Certificate`

---

### 2. **Many**

🔹 **Example**:
A **library** has **many books**.

🗂️ Relationship:
`Library (1) — (Many) Books`

---

### 3. **One (and only one)**

🔹 **Example**:
Every **citizen** must have **exactly one social security number**.

🗂️ Relationship:
`Citizen (1) — (Exactly 1) SSN`

---

### 4. **Zero or One**

🔹 **Example**:
An **employee** may have **zero or one company car**.

🗂️ Relationship:
`Employee (0 or 1) — (1) Car`

---

### 5. **One or Many**

🔹 **Example**:
A **teacher** teaches **one or more classes**.

🗂️ Relationship:
`Teacher (1 or Many) — (1) Class`

---

### 6. **Zero or Many**

🔹 **Example**:
A **customer** may place **zero or many orders**.

🗂️ Relationship:
`Customer (0 or Many) — (1) Order`

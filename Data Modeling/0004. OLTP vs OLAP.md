* Handles **day-to-day operations**
* Supports **real-time, short, frequent transactions**
* Focus is on **insert/update/delete** operations with data integrity and speed
* File Format: Often stored in relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server

### üî∑ What is OLAP?

**OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**

* Used for **data analysis and reporting**
* Handles **complex queries** and **aggregations** on large volumes of data
* Focus is on **read-heavy**, historical data analysis
* File Format: Often stored in columnar formats like Parquet, ORC, or Avro
* Format Type: Column-based storage
* Example Format: .parquet file (used in tools like Power BI, Spark, Hive)

#### ‚úÖ Example:

* **Sales dashboard** showing quarterly trends
* **Marketing analysis** on campaign performance across regions

#### üí° Sample OLAP Query:

GROUP BY ProductCategory;
```

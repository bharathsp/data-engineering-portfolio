### 📘 What is a **Normal Form**?

**Normal Forms (NF)** are **rules or guidelines** used in **relational database design** to organize data efficiently, eliminate **data redundancy**, and maintain **data integrity**.

The process of applying these rules is called **Normalization**.

---

### 🎯 Objectives of Normalization

* Eliminate data **redundancy** (repeated data)
* Avoid **anomalies** (insert, update, delete)
* Improve **data integrity**
* Simplify **maintenance** and **queries**

---

## 🔢 Different Normal Forms (1NF to 5NF)

Let’s explain each with **sample data** based on a `StudentCourse` table.

---

### 🔹 **Unnormalized Table (UNF)**

| StudentID | StudentName | Courses       |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1         | Alice       | Math, Physics |
| 2         | Bob         | Chemistry     |

* Problem: Multivalued attribute `Courses`

---

### 🔹 **1NF (First Normal Form)** – Eliminate repeating groups

✅ Rule:

* Each cell must contain **atomic values** (no lists or sets)
* Each record must be **unique**

📋 Table:

| StudentID | StudentName | Course    |
| --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 1         | Alice       | Math      |
| 1         | Alice       | Physics   |
| 2         | Bob         | Chemistry |

🟢 Fixed: Multivalued attribute
🔴 Still has redundancy (`StudentName` repeated)

---

### 🔹 **2NF (Second Normal Form)** – Remove partial dependencies

✅ Rule:

* Must be in **1NF**
* No **partial dependency** (i.e., no attribute depends only on part of a **composite primary key**)

🧠 Split into two tables:

**Student Table:**

| StudentID | StudentName |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1         | Alice       |
| 2         | Bob         |

**Enrollment Table:**

| StudentID | Course    |
| --------- | --------- |
| 1         | Math      |
| 1         | Physics   |
| 2         | Chemistry |

🟢 Removed partial dependency (StudentName no longer depends on just StudentID in a composite key)

---

### 🔹 **3NF (Third Normal Form)** – Remove transitive dependencies

✅ Rule:

* Must be in **2NF**
* No **transitive dependency** (non-key attribute should not depend on another non-key attribute)

🔍 Example Problem:

| StudentID | StudentName | DeptID | DeptName  |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | --------- |
| 1         | Alice       | D1     | Physics   |
| 2         | Bob         | D2     | Chemistry |

Here, `DeptName` depends on `DeptID`, not directly on `StudentID`.

🧠 Split into:

**Student Table:**

| StudentID | StudentName | DeptID |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 1         | Alice       | D1     |
| 2         | Bob         | D2     |

**Department Table:**

| DeptID | DeptName  |
| ------ | --------- |
| D1     | Physics   |
| D2     | Chemistry |

🟢 Eliminated transitive dependency

---

### 🔹 **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)** – Stronger 3NF

✅ Rule:

* For **every functional dependency**, the **left-hand side must be a super key**

Used when 3NF fails due to composite keys and overlapping candidate keys.

🔍 Rare but important in advanced designs.

---

### 🔹 **4NF (Fourth Normal Form)** – Remove multivalued dependencies

✅ Rule:

* Must be in **BCNF**
* No **multivalued dependency** unless it’s a **trivial dependency**

🧠 Useful in many-to-many-to-many relationships (e.g., student with multiple skills and hobbies)

---

### 🔹 **5NF (Fifth Normal Form)** – Decompose join dependencies

✅ Rule:

* All **join dependencies** are implied by candidate keys

🧠 Useful when decomposing complex relationships without losing data

## ✅ Advantages of Normalization

| Advantage              | Description                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Avoids redundancy**  | Less duplication means less storage and cleaner data |
| **Improves integrity** | Data is more consistent and accurate                 |
| **Easier updates**     | Fewer places to update when a value changes          |
| **Query efficiency**   | Easier joins and indexing                            |

---

## ❌ Disadvantages of Normalization

| Disadvantage                | Description                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Complex queries**         | Too many tables may require more joins                         |
| **Performance cost**        | Joins across many tables may slow down reads                   |
| **Not ideal for reporting** | Denormalized data is often preferred in analytics/BI           |
| **Harder for beginners**    | Understanding multiple forms and relationships adds complexity |

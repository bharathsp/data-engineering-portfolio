### üî∑ What are Fact and Dimension Tables?

In **data warehousing** and **business intelligence**, data is typically organized into two types of tables:

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Fact Table**

* A **Fact Table** contains **measurable, quantitative data**‚Äîthe metrics or **facts** of a business process.
* It is the **central table** in a star or snowflake schema.

#### üí° Example:

For a retail business, a `Sales_Fact` table might include:

| Sale\_ID | Date\_ID | Product\_ID | Store\_ID | Quantity\_Sold | Total\_Amount |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| 101      | 20230101 | 501         | 30        | 3              | 1500          |

**Key Points:**

* Stores **measures** (e.g., sales, revenue, profit)
* Uses **foreign keys** to reference dimension tables
* Rows are **numerous** (millions or more)

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Dimension Table**

* A **Dimension Table** contains **descriptive attributes** (context) related to facts.
* It helps in slicing and dicing the facts during analysis.

#### üí° Example:

`Product_Dimension`:

| Product\_ID | Product\_Name | Category    | Brand | Price |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----- | ----- |
| 501         | Laptop X      | Electronics | Dell  | 500   |

`Date_Dimension`:

| Date\_ID | Day | Month | Year |
| -------- | --- | ----- | ---- |
| 20230101 | 01  | Jan   | 2023 |

**Key Points:**

* Contains **categorical data** (attributes)
* Used to **filter**, **group**, or **label** facts
* Rows are **relatively fewer**

---

### ‚ùì Why are Fact and Dimension Tables Required?

1. **Data Organization:**

   * Separates numerical data (facts) from descriptive data (dimensions).
   * Improves clarity and modular design.

2. **Query Performance:**

   * Optimized schema improves **query speed** with joins between fact and dimension tables.

3. **Data Redundancy Reduction:**

   * Instead of repeating product or customer details in every row, use dimension keys‚Äîreducing storage.

4. **Scalability:**

   * Fact tables grow rapidly, dimensions change slowly‚Äîthis design supports efficient scaling.

5. **Analytical Flexibility:**

   * Enables slicing (e.g., by region), dicing (e.g., by time and product), drilling down (e.g., year ‚Üí month ‚Üí day).

### üß† In Summary:

| Feature       | Fact Table                | Dimension Table          |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Contains      | Numeric metrics           | Descriptive attributes   |
| Grows rapidly | Yes                       | No                       |
| Primary key   | Composite of foreign keys | Surrogate or natural key |
| Example       | Sales, Revenue            | Product, Customer, Date  |
| Used for      | Aggregations              | Filtering & grouping     |

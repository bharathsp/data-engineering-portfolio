### üìä What is the **Metadata Database** in Apache Airflow?

The **Metadata Database** is the **central database** used by Airflow to **track the state of all workflows**, tasks, and their execution history.

---

### üß† **Simple Definition:**

> The Metadata Database is where Airflow stores everything it needs to **monitor, manage, and restart workflows**.

### üîê **What Gets Stored in the Metadata DB?**

| Table Name                   | Stores Information About                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dag`                        | DAG definitions                                             |
| `dag_run`                    | Each DAG run (execution date, state, etc.)                  |
| `task_instance`              | Each run of every task (status, start time, logs, etc.)     |
| `xcom`                       | Cross-task communication (data passed between tasks)        |
| `log`                        | Logs of all task runs                                       |
| `variable`                   | User-defined key-value pairs                                |
| `connection`                 | Credentials and connections to external systems (DBs, APIs) |
| `user`, `role`, `permission` | RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) data                       |

### üß© **Why It's Important:**

* Tracks **what ran**, **when**, and **whether it succeeded or failed**
* Used by the **Scheduler** to determine what tasks are due
* Powers the **Web UI** for monitoring workflows
* Supports **retries, backfills, and alerting**
* Essential for **resuming** workflows after failure or downtime

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Supported Databases:**

By default:

* **SQLite** (for testing or dev only)

Recommended for production:

* **PostgreSQL**
* **MySQL/MariaDB**

Set in `airflow.cfg` or via environment variable `AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN`

Example:

```bash
AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@localhost:5432/airflow_db
```

### üîÑ **How It Connects with Other Components:**

```
[DAG File] ‚Üí [Scheduler] ‚Üí [Metadata DB] ‚Üê‚Üí [Web UI]
                                ‚Üì
                           [Executor]
```

* Scheduler **reads/writes** DAG and task state here.
* Web UI **displays** data from here.
* Executors **update** task status here.

## Hooks

In **Apache Airflow**, **Hooks** are **interfaces to external systems**. They abstract the logic for connecting to services like databases, cloud providers, APIs, and message queues.

---

### üß† **Simple Definition:**

> A **Hook** is a **Python class** in Airflow that helps you **connect to and interact with external systems**, such as MySQL, AWS S3, Google BigQuery, etc.

---

### üîó **Why Use Hooks?**

* Simplifies connection logic
* Reuses credentials stored in Airflow's **Connections**
* Avoids hardcoding usernames, passwords, tokens in your DAGs
* Ensures secure and maintainable integration

### üß© **Example Use Cases:**

| System          | Hook                  |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| MySQL           | `MySqlHook`           |
| Postgres        | `PostgresHook`        |
| AWS S3          | `S3Hook`              |
| Google BigQuery | `BigQueryHook`        |
| REST APIs       | `HttpHook`            |
| FTP/SFTP        | `FtpHook`, `SFTPHook` |

---

### üì¶ **Using a Hook (Example with PostgresHook):**

```python
from airflow.hooks.postgres_hook import PostgresHook

def fetch_data_from_postgres():
    hook = PostgresHook(postgres_conn_id='my_postgres_conn')
    connection = hook.get_conn()
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    print(rows)
```

* `my_postgres_conn` is defined in **Airflow Connections UI**
* Hook handles authentication and connection reuse

### üéØ **Hooks vs Operators vs Tasks:**

| Component    | Role                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Hook**     | Connects to external systems (e.g., DB, API)  |
| **Operator** | Executes logic (often using hooks internally) |
| **Task**     | An instance of an operator within a DAG       |

> üîç Operators often **call Hooks internally** to perform actions like running queries or uploading files.

---

### üìö **Custom Hooks:**

You can create your own hook by subclassing `BaseHook` if you need to connect to a custom API or service:

```python
from airflow.hooks.base import BaseHook

class MyCustomAPIHook(BaseHook):
    def __init__(self, conn_id):
        self.conn_id = conn_id
        self.conn = self.get_connection(conn_id)
    
    def call_api(self, endpoint):
        token = self.conn.password
        url = f"{self.conn.host}/{endpoint}"
        # logic to call the API using requests or httpx
```

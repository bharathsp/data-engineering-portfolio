## Executor

In **Apache Airflow**, the **Executor** is the component responsible for **running the actual tasks** that the **Scheduler** has scheduled.

---

### ⚙️ **Simple Definition:**

> The **Executor** takes tasks from the Scheduler and **executes them on the system** — locally, on workers, in containers, or in Kubernetes pods.

---

### 🧠 **Workflow Overview:**

1. **Scheduler**: Determines what tasks should run and when.
2. **Executor**: Runs those tasks (executes the code in the task).

### ⚡ **Types of Executors in Airflow:**

| Executor Type          | Description                                                        | Use Case                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **SequentialExecutor** | Runs **one task at a time**                                        | For development or testing                      |
| **LocalExecutor**      | Runs **multiple tasks in parallel** using Python's multiprocessing | Small to medium scale                           |
| **CeleryExecutor**     | Distributes tasks to **multiple worker nodes** using Celery        | For large-scale, distributed environments       |
| **KubernetesExecutor** | Runs each task in a **separate Kubernetes Pod**                    | Cloud-native, scalable, containerized workflows |
| **DaskExecutor**       | Uses Dask cluster to run tasks in parallel                         | For parallel computing environments             |

### 🔧 **Example Configuration (airflow\.cfg):**

```ini
[core]
executor = LocalExecutor
```

You can also set this in the environment variable or in your `airflow.yaml` config (for newer versions).

---

### 🔗 **How Scheduler & Executor Work Together:**

```plaintext
[DAG] --> [Scheduler] --> [Executor] --> [Run Task Code]
```

For example, if you have a task using `PythonOperator`, the executor will:

* Launch a Python process
* Run the assigned function
* Capture the logs and task state

---

### 📍 **Things Executor Handles:**

* Running the task code
* Retrying failed tasks (if configured)
* Logging output
* Marking task as success/failure in the metadata DB

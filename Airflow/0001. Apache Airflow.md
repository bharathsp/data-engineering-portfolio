## **Apache Airflow**

**Apache Airflow** is an open-source workflow orchestration tool used to **programmatically author, schedule, and monitor data workflows** (pipelines).

### 🔧 **Key Concepts of Airflow:**

| Concept                          | Description                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** | A collection of tasks organized to run in a specific order.                      |
| **Task**                         | A single unit of work (e.g., run a Python function, execute SQL).                |
| **Operator**                     | A template for a task (e.g., `PythonOperator`, `BashOperator`, `EmailOperator`). |
| **Scheduler**                    | Triggers tasks based on time or external events.                                 |
| **Executor**                     | Determines how tasks are executed (locally, via Celery, Kubernetes, etc.).       |
| **Web UI**                       | Web-based UI to monitor and manage workflows.                                    |
| **XCom (Cross Communication)**   | Used to pass data between tasks.                                                 |

### 🚀 **Why Use Airflow?**

* **Python-based:** Workflows are defined in Python code.
* **Scalable:** Works with distributed systems using Celery or Kubernetes.
* **Dynamic:** DAGs can be generated dynamically using code.
* **Monitoring:** Comes with a powerful Web UI for real-time monitoring.
* **Extensible:** Build custom operators, sensors, and hooks.

### 📋 **Simple DAG Example:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def say_hello():
    print("Hello from Airflow!")

with DAG("hello_world_dag", start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval="@daily", catchup=False) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id="say_hello_task",
        python_callable=say_hello
    )
```

### 🧠 **Use Cases:**

* ETL/ELT pipelines
* Data quality checks
* Machine learning model training
* Scheduled reporting
* File system monitoring

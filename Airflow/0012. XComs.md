### 🔄 What are **XComs** in Apache Airflow?

**XComs** (short for **Cross-Communication**) allow **tasks in a DAG to exchange small pieces of data** — such as strings, numbers, lists, or dictionaries.

---

### 🧠 **Simple Definition:**

> **XComs** let one task **send data** to another task in the same DAG run.

They are used to **pass data between tasks** that are executed at different times, without needing external storage.

---

### 📦 **Typical Use Case:**

1. **Task A** computes or fetches a value (e.g., API token, timestamp).
2. It **pushes** the value using XCom.
3. **Task B** later **pulls** that value and uses it.

---

### 🔧 **XCom Push & Pull Examples:**

#### ✅ Push (Send data):

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def push_data(**context):
    context['ti'].xcom_push(key='my_key', value='Hello Airflow')

```

#### ✅ Pull (Receive data):

```python
def pull_data(**context):
    value = context['ti'].xcom_pull(task_ids='push_task', key='my_key')
    print("Pulled value:", value)
```

---

### 🧩 **Key Parameters in `xcom_pull`:**

| Parameter          | Description                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `task_ids`         | Task ID of the task that pushed the value    |
| `key`              | The key used to store the value              |
| `dag_id`, `run_id` | Optional scope (defaults to current DAG/run) |

---

### 🛠️ **Implicit XComs (Return Value):**

If a **PythonOperator** returns a value, Airflow **automatically stores it as an XCom**.

```python
def my_func():
    return "Airflow Rocks!"  # This gets stored as an XCom

# Later task can pull it with:
context['ti'].xcom_pull(task_ids='my_func_task')
```

---

### 🔐 **XComs Storage:**

* Stored in the **Airflow metadata database**, in the `xcom` table.
* Suitable for **small pieces of data** (not large files or big datasets).

---

### 🚫 **What Not to Use XComs For:**

* Don't use XComs to transfer **large files**, dataframes, or binary blobs.
* For large data, use a shared storage system (e.g., S3, GCS, DB) and pass references (e.g., file paths or IDs) via XCom.

---

### 🔍 **Viewing XComs:**

* Go to the **Airflow Web UI → DAG → Task Instance → XComs tab**.
* You can view what values were pushed/pulled during execution.

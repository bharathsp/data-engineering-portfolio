## Task

In **Apache Airflow**, a **Task** is a **single unit of work** within a workflow (DAG). It represents **one action** to be executed â€” for example, running a Python function, executing a SQL query, or sending an email.

### ðŸ§± **What is a Task?**

> A **Task** is an instance of an **Operator** â€” it's the actual thing that gets scheduled and executed in a DAG.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Example Tasks:**

| Task Description            | Operator Used           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Run a Python function       | `PythonOperator`        |
| Execute a Bash command      | `BashOperator`          |
| Run a SQL query on Postgres | `PostgresOperator`      |
| Trigger another DAG         | `TriggerDagRunOperator` |
| Send an email               | `EmailOperator`         |

---

### ðŸ“¦ **Airflow Code Example:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def greet():
    print("Hello from Airflow Task!")

with DAG('example_dag', start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval='@daily', catchup=False) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id='say_hello',
        python_callable=greet
    )
```

Here, `task1` is a **Task** that runs the `greet()` function.

### ðŸ”— **Task Lifecycle (States):**

| State             | Meaning                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `queued`          | Waiting to run                      |
| `running`         | Currently executing                 |
| `success`         | Completed successfully              |
| `failed`          | Ended with an error                 |
| `skipped`         | Skipped due to conditions           |
| `upstream_failed` | Not run because a dependency failed |

---

### ðŸ§  **Key Properties of a Task:**

* **task\_id**: Unique name within the DAG
* **depends\_on\_past**: Waits for the previous run to succeed before running again
* **retries**: Number of retry attempts on failure
* **retry\_delay**: Time delay between retries
* **execution\_timeout**: Max allowed run time

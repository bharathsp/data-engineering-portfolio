### üöÄ Airflow Deployment Modes Explained

Apache Airflow can be deployed in **various execution modes**, depending on your **scale**, **infrastructure**, and **team needs**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. **LocalExecutor**

* **What it is:** Executes tasks in **parallel** on the same machine using Python's multiprocessing.
* **Use Case:** Development, small-scale production setups.
* **Pros:**

  * Easy to set up
  * Supports parallelism
* **Cons:**

  * Limited by the resources of a **single machine**

üõ†Ô∏è Enable by setting in `airflow.cfg`:

```ini
executor = LocalExecutor
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. **CeleryExecutor**

* **What it is:** Executes tasks **asynchronously** across multiple worker machines using **Celery** with a message broker (Redis or RabbitMQ).
* **Use Case:** Scalable production setups with **distributed workers**
* **Pros:**

  * Highly scalable
  * Fault-tolerant
* **Cons:**

  * Complex to deploy (needs Redis/RabbitMQ + result backend)

üõ†Ô∏è Key components:

* Airflow Webserver
* Scheduler
* Celery Workers
* Message Broker (Redis/RabbitMQ)
* Metadata DB

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. **KubernetesExecutor**

* **What it is:** Spins up a **dedicated Kubernetes pod** for each task.
* **Use Case:** Containerized, cloud-native environments with Kubernetes.
* **Pros:**

  * Fully isolated tasks
  * Scales with Kubernetes
  * No need for Celery or static worker nodes
* **Cons:**

  * Requires Kubernetes expertise
  * Cold-start overhead

üõ†Ô∏è Each task = 1 pod
üß± Good for **multi-tenant** or secure environments

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. **Managed Services (MWAA / Cloud Composer)**

#### ‚úÖ **Amazon MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow)**

* Fully managed Airflow on AWS
* Integrates with S3, IAM, CloudWatch, etc.
* Pay-as-you-go
* Less flexibility in customization

#### ‚úÖ **Google Cloud Composer**

* Managed Airflow on GCP
* Integrated with BigQuery, GCS, Stackdriver, etc.
* Good for GCP-based pipelines

**Pros (for both):**

* No infra management
* Auto-scaling
* Security and monitoring handled

**Cons:**

* Limited plugin customization
* Vendor lock-in
* Higher cost than self-managed

### üìä Summary Comparison

| Executor               | Scaling   | Infra Required     | Best For               |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **LocalExecutor**      | Limited   | Single machine     | Dev/small teams        |
| **CeleryExecutor**     | High      | Redis + Workers    | Distributed workloads  |
| **KubernetesExecutor** | Very High | Kubernetes cluster | Cloud-native workloads |
| **MWAA/Composer**      | Very High | Fully managed      | Low-ops cloud users    |

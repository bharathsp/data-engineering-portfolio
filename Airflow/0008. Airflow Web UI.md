## Airflow Web UI

The **Airflow Web UI** is a **graphical interface** provided by Apache Airflow to **monitor, manage, and troubleshoot DAGs, tasks, and workflows**.

---

### 🎯 **Purpose of the Web UI:**

> Allows users to **interact with workflows** visually — check DAG status, run tasks, view logs, handle failures, and more — all through a browser.

---

### 🌐 **Accessing the Web UI:**

By default, you can access it at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Login credentials are usually set during installation or via environment variables.

### 🧩 **Key Sections in Airflow Web UI:**

| Section                | Description                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DAGs List View**     | Lists all available DAGs with options to trigger, pause, or view details.             |
| **Graph View**         | Visual graph of the DAG — shows task dependencies.                                    |
| **Tree View**          | Timeline of DAG runs and task statuses (color-coded: success, failed, skipped, etc.). |
| **Gantt View**         | Task duration and overlaps for performance monitoring.                                |
| **Code View**          | Shows the actual Python code of the DAG.                                              |
| **Task Instance Logs** | Logs from individual task runs for debugging.                                         |
| **Calendar View**      | Shows execution history over time.                                                    |
| **Audit Logs**         | Tracks user activity on the platform (if enabled).                                    |

### 🔄 **Common Actions via UI:**

* ✅ Trigger DAG runs manually
* ⏸️ Pause/resume DAGs
* 🔁 Clear failed task instances (to re-run)
* 🔍 View and download logs
* ⛔ Mark tasks as success/failed
* 🔃 Refresh DAG definitions

### 🎨 **Color Indicators in Tree View:**

| Color     | Meaning   |
| --------- | --------- |
| 🟩 Green  | Success   |
| 🔴 Red    | Failed    |
| ⬜️ White  | No status |
| 🟦 Blue   | Running   |

### 🔐 **User Access (RBAC - Role-Based Access Control):**

Airflow Web UI supports multiple user roles:

* **Admin**
* **User**
* **Viewer**
* **Op**

You can assign different permissions for triggering DAGs, editing, or only viewing.

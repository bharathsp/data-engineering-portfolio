## DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

A **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** is a **graph structure** used to represent workflows or processes, where:

* **Directed**: Each edge (arrow) has a direction, indicating the flow (e.g., task A → task B).
* **Acyclic**: There are **no loops or cycles**, meaning a task cannot depend on itself—directly or indirectly.

---

### 🔁 **In simple terms:**

> A DAG is a **flowchart of tasks**, where each task must run **after certain others**, and the flow **never loops back**.

---

### 📦 **In Apache Airflow:**

A **DAG** defines the **structure of a workflow**—how tasks are organized and in what order they should run.

---

### 🧠 **Example DAG Flow:**

```text
Start
  |
Extract Data
  |
Transform Data
  |
Load to Database
  |
Send Notification
```

This flow can be represented as a DAG:

* `Extract → Transform → Load → Notify`
* Each arrow shows task **dependencies**
* No backward flow = **acyclic**

### ✅ **Key Properties:**

| Property     | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Directed** | Arrows point from one task to the next (shows dependency)            |
| **Acyclic**  | No cycles—ensures a task doesn’t run forever or cause infinite loops |
| **Graph**    | Represents nodes (tasks) and edges (dependencies)                    |

### 🛠️ **Airflow Code Example:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG("simple_dag", start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval="@daily") as dag:
    start = DummyOperator(task_id="start")
    task_a = DummyOperator(task_id="task_a")
    task_b = DummyOperator(task_id="task_b")
    end = DummyOperator(task_id="end")

    start >> [task_a, task_b] >> end
```

This DAG does:

```
         → task_a →
start →             → end
         → task_b →
```

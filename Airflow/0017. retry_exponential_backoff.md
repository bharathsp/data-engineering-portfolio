### ⏳ `retry_exponential_backoff` in Apache Airflow

In **Apache Airflow**, **backoff** refers to how the **delay between task retries increases over time**, especially in the context of **retrying failed tasks**.

---

### 🧠 **Simple Definition:**

> **Backoff** means "wait longer between each retry."
> When `retry_exponential_backoff=True`, Airflow uses an **exponential delay** strategy instead of a fixed delay between retries.

---

### 🔁 **Default Retry Delay (without backoff):**

```python
retries=3
retry_delay=timedelta(minutes=5)
```

* Retry 1 → Wait 5 min
* Retry 2 → Wait 5 min
* Retry 3 → Wait 5 min
  *(total retry window = 15 mins)*

---

### ⚡ **With Exponential Backoff:**

```python
retries=3
retry_delay=timedelta(minutes=5)
retry_exponential_backoff=True
max_retry_delay=timedelta(minutes=30)
```

* Retry 1 → Wait 5 min
* Retry 2 → Wait \~10 min
* Retry 3 → Wait \~20 min
* Delay grows exponentially (but capped at 30 minutes)

---

### 📦 **How to Use in a Task:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def unstable_task():
    raise Exception("Temporary failure")

with DAG(
    dag_id='backoff_example_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2025, 7, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False
) as dag:

    retrying_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='unstable_task',
        python_callable=unstable_task,
        retries=5,
        retry_delay=timedelta(seconds=30),
        retry_exponential_backoff=True,
        max_retry_delay=timedelta(minutes=5)
    )
```

### 📌 **Why Use Backoff?**

| Benefit              | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌐 Prevents flooding | Avoid hammering external systems with rapid retries  |
| 🧘 More stable       | Gives services time to recover                       |
| 🔒 Safer retries     | Useful when working with flaky APIs, databases, etc. |

---

### 🧮 **Backoff Formula (Simplified):**

```python
delay = min(
    base_delay * (2 ^ (attempt_number - 1)),
    max_retry_delay
)
```

So it doubles after each failure — unless capped by `max_retry_delay`.

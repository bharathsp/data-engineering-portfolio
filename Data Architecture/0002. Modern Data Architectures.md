# üìä Modern Data Architectures

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ ETL (Extract ‚Üí Transform ‚Üí Load)

**Highlights**

* Classic architecture for moving data from source ‚Üí transformation ‚Üí target (usually Data Warehouse).
* Well-suited for structured and batch data.

**Advantages**

* Strong schema enforcement ‚Üí data consistency.
* Mature ecosystem (Informatica, Talend, SSIS).
* Works well with relational data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery).

**Use Cases**

* Monthly sales reporting.
* Financial compliance reporting.
* Traditional BI dashboards.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best for **small/medium datasets** that are structured, with well-defined schema and business rules.
‚ùå Not ideal for real-time or unstructured data.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Lake

**Highlights**

* Stores raw data (structured + semi-structured + unstructured).
* Built on low-cost storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake, GCP Cloud Storage).

**Advantages**

* Schema-on-read ‚Üí flexibility.
* Handles massive scale at low cost.
* Ideal for ML, AI, and advanced analytics.

**Use Cases**

* Collecting IoT sensor data.
* Customer 360 (logs, clickstream, CRM).
* Data science exploration.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best for **big data, ML/AI, and exploratory analytics**.
‚ùå Avoid if you only need traditional BI (can become a ‚Äúdata swamp‚Äù without governance).

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda Architecture

**Highlights**

* Combines **batch + streaming** pipelines.
* Batch layer for accuracy, speed layer for real-time.
* Queries merge results from both layers.

**Advantages**

* Supports both **real-time** and **historical** analytics.
* Fault-tolerant and scalable.
* Balances speed with accuracy.

**Use Cases**

* Fraud detection in banking.
* Real-time ad bidding platforms.
* Social media analytics.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best when you need **real-time + batch insights** (speed + accuracy).
‚ùå Complex ‚Üí higher dev & ops cost.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Kappa Architecture

**Highlights**

* **Streaming-first** architecture (no separate batch layer).
* Single pipeline for processing real-time + replays.

**Advantages**

* Simplifies Lambda (no duplicate logic).
* Unified processing ‚Üí less maintenance.
* Ideal for event-driven systems.

**Use Cases**

* IoT event processing.
* Real-time personalization (Netflix, Spotify).
* Stock market price monitoring.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best if **real-time is priority** and batch is less critical.
‚ùå Not suitable when strict **historical batch accuracy** is needed.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Medallion Architecture (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold)

<img width="903" height="353" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef7429c9-012c-4f03-8dc7-5df2c2507d23" />

**Highlights**

* Modern layered design (popularized by Databricks).
* **Bronze** = raw data
* **Silver** = cleaned, conformed data
* **Gold** = curated business-level data

**Advantages**

* Incremental quality improvements.
* Supports both **data science** and **BI**.
* Works great with **Delta Lake** & Lakehouse.

**Use Cases**

* Enterprise data lakehouses.
* Marketing funnel analysis.
* Supply chain & sales forecasting.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best when building a **scalable data lakehouse** with both ML + BI needs.
‚ùå Requires strong governance & investment in pipeline design.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Data Vault Architecture

**Highlights**

* Hybrid architecture for **enterprise data warehouses**.
* Separates data into:

  * **Hubs** (business keys)
  * **Links** (relationships)
  * **Satellites** (context, history, attributes).
* Designed for **agility + auditability**.

**Advantages**

* Handles **historical data** and **changes over time** gracefully.
* Highly **scalable and adaptable** to new data sources.
* Strong **data lineage & auditability** (good for compliance).

**Use Cases**

* Financial services (regulatory compliance).
* Healthcare (long-term patient history).
* Enterprises with **frequent schema changes**.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best when **data lineage, audit, and historical traceability** are critical.
‚ùå Avoid for **small/simple BI projects** (can be overkill).

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Kimball‚Äôs Dimensional Data Warehouse (Star Schema / Bus Architecture)

**Highlights**

* Bottom-up approach: build **data marts** for business processes ‚Üí integrate into **enterprise warehouse**.
* Uses **star schema** (fact + dimension tables).
* Very popular for **BI & OLAP**.

**Advantages**

* Simple and intuitive for business analysts.
* Optimized for **fast querying & reporting**.
* Incremental build (start small, scale out).

**Use Cases**

* Retail sales reporting.
* Marketing campaign performance.
* Manufacturing KPI dashboards.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best for **BI-heavy organizations** needing quick insights.
‚ùå Not great for **complex historical tracking** or **unstructured data**.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Inmon‚Äôs Corporate Information Factory (CIF)

**Highlights**

* Top-down approach: build a **centralized enterprise data warehouse (EDW)** first, then create **data marts**.
* Strong focus on **data integration & governance**.
* Data modeled in **3rd normal form (3NF)** in the EDW.

**Advantages**

* Provides a **single version of truth** across enterprise.
* Great for **complex, enterprise-wide integration**.
* Strong governance & data quality.

**Use Cases**

* Large enterprises with many business domains.
* Telecom, Banking, Government (with compliance needs).
* Organizations needing **enterprise-level master data**.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best for **large, mature enterprises** with focus on governance & integration.

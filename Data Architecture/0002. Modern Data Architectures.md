# üìä Modern Data Architectures

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ ETL (Extract ‚Üí Transform ‚Üí Load)

**Highlights**

* Classic architecture for moving data from source ‚Üí transformation ‚Üí target (usually Data Warehouse).
* Well-suited for structured and batch data.

**Advantages**

* Strong schema enforcement ‚Üí data consistency.
* Mature ecosystem (Informatica, Talend, SSIS).
* Works well with relational data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery).

**Use Cases**

* Monthly sales reporting.
* Financial compliance reporting.
* Traditional BI dashboards.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best for **small/medium datasets** that are structured, with well-defined schema and business rules.
‚ùå Not ideal for real-time or unstructured data.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Lake

**Highlights**

* Stores raw data (structured + semi-structured + unstructured).
* Built on low-cost storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake, GCP Cloud Storage).

**Advantages**

* Schema-on-read ‚Üí flexibility.
* Handles massive scale at low cost.
* Ideal for ML, AI, and advanced analytics.

**Use Cases**

* Collecting IoT sensor data.
* Customer 360 (logs, clickstream, CRM).
* Data science exploration.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best for **big data, ML/AI, and exploratory analytics**.
‚ùå Avoid if you only need traditional BI (can become a ‚Äúdata swamp‚Äù without governance).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda Architecture

**Highlights**

* Combines **batch + streaming** pipelines.
* Batch layer for accuracy, speed layer for real-time.
* Queries merge results from both layers.

**Advantages**

* Supports both **real-time** and **historical** analytics.
* Fault-tolerant and scalable.
* Balances speed with accuracy.

**Use Cases**

* Fraud detection in banking.
* Real-time ad bidding platforms.
* Social media analytics.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best when you need **real-time + batch insights** (speed + accuracy).
‚ùå Complex ‚Üí higher dev & ops cost.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Kappa Architecture

**Highlights**

* **Streaming-first** architecture (no separate batch layer).
* Single pipeline for processing real-time + replays.

**Advantages**

* Simplifies Lambda (no duplicate logic).
* Unified processing ‚Üí less maintenance.
* Ideal for event-driven systems.

**Use Cases**

* IoT event processing.
* Real-time personalization (Netflix, Spotify).
* Stock market price monitoring.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best if **real-time is priority** and batch is less critical.
‚ùå Not suitable when strict **historical batch accuracy** is needed.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Medallion Architecture (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold)

**Highlights**

* Modern layered design (popularized by Databricks).
* **Bronze** = raw data
* **Silver** = cleaned, conformed data
* **Gold** = curated business-level data

**Advantages**

* Incremental quality improvements.
* Supports both **data science** and **BI**.
* Works great with **Delta Lake** & Lakehouse.

**Use Cases**

* Enterprise data lakehouses.
* Marketing funnel analysis.
* Supply chain & sales forecasting.

**When to Use**
‚úîÔ∏è Best when building a **scalable data lakehouse** with both ML + BI needs.
‚ùå Requires strong governance & investment in pipeline design.

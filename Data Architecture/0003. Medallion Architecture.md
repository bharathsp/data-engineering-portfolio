**Medallion Architecture** (also called **Multi-hop Architecture**) is a **data design pattern** used in **data lakehouses** (like Delta Lake) to **organize and improve the quality of data** as it flows through stages:

---

### 🥇 **Bronze → 🥈 Silver → 🥇 Gold**

Each layer in this architecture represents a "medal level" of **data quality, structure, and readiness for analytics**.

---

### 🔄 **Three Layers of Medallion Architecture:**

| Layer         | Purpose                      | Data Characteristics                               | Example                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🥉 **Bronze** | Raw data ingestion           | Raw, unprocessed, messy, possibly duplicate        | Logs, sensor data, API dumps             |
| 🥈 **Silver** | Cleaned and enriched data    | Filtered, deduplicated, joined with reference data | Cleaned sales orders, with customer info |
| 🥇 **Gold**   | Business-level, curated data | Aggregated, business-ready data models             | Revenue per region, dashboard data       |

---

🥉 **Bronze**

The Bronze Layer serves as the initial stage of data ingestion. In this layer, raw data is collected from
multiple sources, including point-of-sale systems, online transactions, IoT devices, and other datagenerating systems. This raw data is stored in its original format within a data lake, which allows for the
storage of large volumes of diverse data types without immediate transformation.

🥈 **Silver**

The Silver Layer focuses on cleaning and enriching the raw data ingested in the Bronze Layer. During this
phase, data undergoes a series of transformations designed to improve its quality and usability. Key
processes include the removal of duplicates, standardization of data formats, correction of errors, and
integration of additional contextual information, such as customer demographics or product metadata.

🥇 **Gold**

The Gold Layer represents the final stage in the Medallion Architecture, where data is aggregated and
refined for specific business applications. This layer focuses on creating business-specific datasets that
are optimized for reporting, dashboarding, and advanced analytics. The data in the Gold Layer is highly
curated and often tailored to meet the needs of various business units, such as finance, marketing, and
operations.

### 📊 **Visual Flow:**

```
        ┌────────────┐
        │  Raw Source│ (e.g., Kafka, APIs, files)
        └─────┬──────┘
              ▼
       🥉 Bronze Layer
    (Raw ingestion layer)
              ▼
       🥈 Silver Layer
    (Cleaned, enriched data)
              ▼
       🥇 Gold Layer
   (Business aggregates and KPIs)
```

### ⚙️ **Use Case Example: E-commerce Platform**

| Layer      | Example                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bronze** | Raw order data, clicks, payment logs ingested from Kafka and S3                |
| **Silver** | Cleaned orders joined with customer and product tables                         |
| **Gold**   | Sales by region, repeat customer metrics, revenue forecasts used in dashboards |

### ✅ **Benefits of Medallion Architecture:**

* **Data Quality Control**: Improvements at each stage (deduplication, validation, standardization).
* **Auditability**: You always keep raw data in Bronze (immutable).
* **Reusability**: Silver layer can serve multiple Gold outputs (dashboards, ML models).
* **Simplifies Debugging**: Trace back issues to earlier layers.

---

### 🔧 **Tools Commonly Used:**

* **Databricks** (with Delta Lake)
* **Apache Spark**
* **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**
* **Airflow / dbt** for orchestration
* **Azure Synapse Pipelines / AWS Glue**

---

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine gold jewelry production:

* **Bronze** = uncut, unpolished raw gold ore
* **Silver** = refined and shaped but not yet finished
* **Gold** = polished, ready-to-sell jewelry

### 💎 What is **Medallion Architecture**?

**Medallion Architecture** (also called **Multi-hop Architecture**) is a **data design pattern** used in **data lakehouses** (like Delta Lake) to **organize and improve the quality of data** as it flows through stages:

---

### 🥇 **Bronze → 🥈 Silver → 🥇 Gold**

Each layer in this architecture represents a "medal level" of **data quality, structure, and readiness for analytics**.

---

### 🔄 **Three Layers of Medallion Architecture:**

| Layer         | Purpose                      | Data Characteristics                               | Example                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🥉 **Bronze** | Raw data ingestion           | Raw, unprocessed, messy, possibly duplicate        | Logs, sensor data, API dumps             |
| 🥈 **Silver** | Cleaned and enriched data    | Filtered, deduplicated, joined with reference data | Cleaned sales orders, with customer info |
| 🥇 **Gold**   | Business-level, curated data | Aggregated, business-ready data models             | Revenue per region, dashboard data       |

---

### 📊 **Visual Flow:**

```
        ┌────────────┐
        │  Raw Source│ (e.g., Kafka, APIs, files)
        └─────┬──────┘
              ▼
       🥉 Bronze Layer
    (Raw ingestion layer)
              ▼
       🥈 Silver Layer
    (Cleaned, enriched data)
              ▼
       🥇 Gold Layer
   (Business aggregates and KPIs)
```

---

### ⚙️ **Use Case Example: E-commerce Platform**

| Layer      | Example                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bronze** | Raw order data, clicks, payment logs ingested from Kafka and S3                |
| **Silver** | Cleaned orders joined with customer and product tables                         |
| **Gold**   | Sales by region, repeat customer metrics, revenue forecasts used in dashboards |

---

### ✅ **Benefits of Medallion Architecture:**

* **Data Quality Control**: Improvements at each stage (deduplication, validation, standardization).
* **Auditability**: You always keep raw data in Bronze (immutable).
* **Reusability**: Silver layer can serve multiple Gold outputs (dashboards, ML models).
* **Simplifies Debugging**: Trace back issues to earlier layers.

---

### 🔧 **Tools Commonly Used:**

* **Databricks** (with Delta Lake)
* **Apache Spark**
* **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**
* **Airflow / dbt** for orchestration
* **Azure Synapse Pipelines / AWS Glue**

---

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine gold jewelry production:

* **Bronze** = uncut, unpolished raw gold ore
* **Silver** = refined and shaped but not yet finished
* **Gold** = polished, ready-to-sell jewelry

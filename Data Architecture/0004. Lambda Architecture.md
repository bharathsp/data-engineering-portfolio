## 🔹 What is Lambda Architecture?

Lambda Architecture is a **data-processing architecture** designed to handle **large-scale data** by combining both **batch processing** (for accuracy and completeness) and **real-time stream processing** (for speed and low latency).

It addresses the need for real-time analytics while simultaneously providing the capability to perform in-depth historical data analysis. This
architecture is particularly effective in scenarios where both low-latency updates and comprehensive data processing are required.

It’s widely used in **big data systems** where both historical and real-time views of data are needed.

## 🔹 Layers of Lambda Architecture

Lambda has **three main layers**:

1. **Batch Layer (Master Data Storage + Batch Processing)**

   * Stores **all raw historical data** (immutable, append-only).
   * Periodically runs heavy computations (e.g., aggregations, model training).
   * Produces a “batch view” → accurate but not real-time.
   * Example: Hadoop, Spark.

2. **Speed Layer (Real-Time / Streaming Processing)**

   * Processes **incoming data streams instantly**.
   * Produces **real-time views** with low latency but less accuracy (approximate results).
   * Example: Apache Kafka, Apache Storm, Spark Streaming, Flink.

3. **Serving Layer (Query Layer)**

   * Combines **batch view** and **real-time view**.
   * Provides a **complete picture** of the data for querying.
   * Example: Cassandra, HBase, Elasticsearch.

## 🔹 Use Case Example

**E-commerce website analytics** (like Amazon, Flipkart):

* **Batch Layer:** Stores complete purchase history, customer data, browsing history. Runs daily analytics for trends (e.g., top products last 30 days).
* **Speed Layer:** Processes real-time events like “Add to Cart,” “Flash Sale,” or “Current Trending Product” in seconds.
* **Serving Layer:** Combines both → A dashboard shows real-time sales trends + historical comparisons.

---

## 🔹 Benefits of Lambda Architecture

✅ **Scalable** – Handles massive volumes of data.
✅ **Fault-tolerant** – Data is stored immutably, so failures don’t corrupt it.
✅ **Real-time + Historical Insights** – Low-latency results from speed layer, accuracy from batch layer.
✅ **Flexibility** – Works with both structured and unstructured data.
✅ **Data Completeness** – No loss of historical data, since raw data is always stored.

## 🔹 Real-World Analogy

Think of **financial reporting** at a stock exchange:

* **Batch Layer** = End-of-day official report (accurate but comes late).
* **Speed Layer** = Stock ticker showing live updates (fast but can have glitches).
* **Serving Layer** = The dashboard traders use → shows both **real-time stock price** + **historical charts**.

Another analogy:
📚 **Library System**

* **Batch Layer:** Archives all books and records (accurate and complete).
* **Speed Layer:** New arrivals shelf showing the latest books (fast updates).
* **Serving Layer:** The catalog that combines both old archives + new arrivals for users.

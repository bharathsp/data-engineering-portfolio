Parallel processing in Python means executing multiple tasks at the same time using **multiple CPU cores**, which can drastically reduce execution time for CPU-bound tasks.

---

## **1️⃣ Why Parallel Processing?**

* Python executes code sequentially by default.
* The **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** allows only one thread to run Python bytecode at a time — bad news for CPU-heavy tasks.
* To bypass GIL for CPU-bound tasks, we use **multiprocessing** (separate processes) instead of threads.

---

## **2️⃣ Ways to Do Parallel Processing in Python**

### **A) Using `multiprocessing` Module**

* Spawns **multiple processes**, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.
* Best for **CPU-bound tasks** (e.g., heavy computations).

**Example:**

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
import os
import time

def work(x):
    print(f"Process {os.getpid()} working on {x}")
    time.sleep(1)
    return x * x

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with Pool(processes=4) as pool:  # Use 4 processes
        results = pool.map(work, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    print("Results:", results)
```

✅ Runs in **parallel** using multiple cores.

---

### **B) Using `concurrent.futures`**

* A **high-level** API for parallelism.
* Supports both **`ThreadPoolExecutor`** (I/O-bound) and **`ProcessPoolExecutor`** (CPU-bound).

**Example (CPU-bound with ProcessPoolExecutor):**

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
import time

def square(n):
    time.sleep(1)
    return n * n

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(square, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
    print(results)
```

---

### **C) Using `joblib` (for Data Science & ML)**

* Great for parallelizing loops in data processing & ML.
* Integrates well with NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

**Example:**

```python
from joblib import Parallel, delayed
import math

def compute(x):
    return math.sqrt(x)

results = Parallel(n_jobs=4)(delayed(compute)(i) for i in range(10))
print(results)
```

---

### **D) Using `Dask`**

* Parallel computing library for **big data**.
* Works with NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
* Runs on a single machine or cluster.

---

## **3️⃣ On-Heap vs Off-Heap Memory Analogy (for Parallelism)**

Imagine your **CPU cores are cooks**:

* Each cook (core) works in a separate kitchen (process).
* Each kitchen has its own ingredients (memory space).
* They work **independently** without fighting over the same cutting board (avoids GIL).

## **4️⃣ Choosing the Right Method**

| Method               | Best For            | Avoids GIL? | Example Use Case |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| `threading`          | I/O-bound tasks     | ❌           | Web scraping     |
| `multiprocessing`    | CPU-bound tasks     | ✅           | Image processing |
| `concurrent.futures` | General-purpose     | ✅ (process) | Parallel loops   |
| `joblib`             | Data science tasks  | ✅           | ML model tuning  |
| `Dask`               | Big data processing | ✅           | Distributed ETL  |

### 1. Parallel processing with threads (`ThreadPoolExecutor`)

Threads are good for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network calls, file I/O).

```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

def task(n):
    print(f"Processing {n}")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate I/O-bound operation
    return n * n

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(task, numbers))

print("Results:", results)
```

**Explanation:**

* `ThreadPoolExecutor` runs up to 3 threads concurrently.
* `executor.map()` applies `task` to all items in `numbers`.
* The program prints results after all tasks complete.

---

### 2. Parallel processing with processes (`ProcessPoolExecutor`)

Processes are good for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy calculations).

```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

def task(n):
    print(f"Processing {n}")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate CPU-bound operation (replace with actual computation)
    return n * n

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(task, numbers))

print("Results:", results)
```

**Note:** On Windows, protect the entry point by wrapping it in `if __name__ == "__main__":` to avoid recursive spawning of processes:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # above code here
```

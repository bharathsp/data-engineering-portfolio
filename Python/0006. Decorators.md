## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What are decorators in Python?**

A **decorator** is a **function that takes another function as input, adds extra functionality to it, and returns the modified function** ‚Äî without changing the original function‚Äôs code.

Think of it like **wrapping a gift**:

* The original gift (function) stays the same.
* The wrapper (decorator) adds beauty or extra protection.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ How does it work?**

A decorator:

1. Takes a function as an argument.
2. Defines a wrapper function that adds something before/after the original function runs.
3. Returns the wrapper function.

This is possible in Python because **functions are first-class citizens** ‚Äî they can be passed around as arguments and returned from other functions.

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Syntax**

```python
@decorator_name
def my_function():
    ...
```

The `@decorator_name` is **just shorthand** for:

```python
my_function = decorator_name(my_function)
```

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Example**

```python
# Step 1: Define a decorator
def greet_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("üëã Hello! Before the function runs...")
        func()
        print("‚úÖ After the function runs...")
    return wrapper

# Step 2: Use @ to apply decorator
@greet_decorator
def say_name():
    print("My name is Python!")

# Step 3: Call the decorated function
say_name()
```

**Output:**

```
üëã Hello! Before the function runs...
My name is Python!
‚úÖ After the function runs...
```

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ When to use decorators?**

* **Logging** (track function calls)
* **Authentication/Authorization** (check if a user is logged in)
* **Timing/Performance measurement** (calculate execution time)
* **Caching results** for expensive operations
* **Validation** (check inputs before running a function)

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Real-life analogy**

Imagine you have **a chef (function)** cooking meals.
You hire **a waiter (decorator)** who:

* Greets the guest before serving food.
* Cleans up after the food is served.
  The chef still cooks the same dish, but the experience is enhanced.

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Real-life Python Example ‚Äì Logging**

```python
import time

def log_execution_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)  # run the function
        end = time.time()
        print(f"‚è± {func.__name__} took {end - start:.4f} seconds to execute.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_execution_time
def process_data():
    time.sleep(1)  # simulating heavy work
    print("üìä Data processed!")

process_data()
```

**Output:**

```
üìä Data processed!
‚è± process_data took 1.0005 seconds to execute.
```

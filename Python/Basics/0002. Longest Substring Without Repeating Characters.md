## 🔠 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the **length** of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

> ⚠️ A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters.  
> ⚠️ A **subsequence** (like `"pwke"`) is **not** valid for this problem.

### 🔍 Examples

#### ✅ Example 1:
```
Input:  s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
```
💡 **Explanation**: The answer is `"abc"`, with a length of `3`.

---

#### ✅ Example 2:
```
Input:  s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
```
💡 **Explanation**: The answer is `"b"`, with a length of `1`.

---

#### ✅ Example 3:
```
Input:  s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
```
💡 **Explanation**: The answer is `"wke"`, with a length of `3`.  
Note: `"pwke"` is a subsequence, not a substring.

---

### 📌 Constraints
- 🧵 `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10⁴`
- 🔤 `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

## 🐍 Python Solution (Sliding Window - O(n))

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_index = {}
        max_len = 0
        start = 0

        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            if ch in char_index and char_index[ch] >= start:
                start = char_index[ch] + 1  # skip the duplicate
            char_index[ch] = i
            max_len = max(max_len, i - start + 1)

        return max_len
```

---

### 🧠 How it Works:
- `char_index`: Stores the **last seen index** of each character.
- `start`: Marks the **start of the current substring**.
- If a duplicate is found **within the current window**, move `start` to one position after the previous occurrence.
- Keep updating the `max_len` with the current window size.

---

### 📈 Time & Space Complexity
- ⏱️ **Time:** O(n)
- 🧠 **Space:** O(min(n, m)) → where `m` is the size of the charset (e.g., 128 for ASCII)

## 🧮 Variables
| Variable       | Description                                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `char_index`   | Dictionary to store the last index where each char was seen |
| `start`        | Start index of the current substring (window)             |
| `max_len`      | Length of the longest substring without duplicates         |

| i | s[i] | char_index        | Condition                              | Action                                                                 | start | max_len |
|---|------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------|
| 0 | 'p'  | `{}`               | 'p' not seen                           | Store `'p': 0` → window is `'p'`                                       | 0     | 1        |
| 1 | 'w'  | `{'p': 0}`         | 'w' not seen                           | Store `'w': 1` → window is `'pw'`                                      | 0     | 2        |
| 2 | 'w'  | `{'p': 0, 'w': 1}` | 'w' seen at 1 ≥ start=0                | Duplicate → move `start = 2`                                           | 2     | 2        |
| 3 | 'k'  | `{'p': 0, 'w': 2}` | 'k' not seen                           | Store `'k': 3` → window is `'wk'`                                      | 2     | 2        |
| 4 | 'e'  | `{'p': 0, 'w': 2, 'k': 3}` | 'e' not seen                  | Store `'e': 4` → window is `'wke'`                                     | 2     | 3 ✅     |
| 5 | 'w'  | `{'p': 0, 'w': 2, 'k': 3, 'e': 4}` | 'w' seen at 2 < start=2   | 'w' outside current window → continue, update `'w': 5` → window `'kew'` | 2     | 3        |

## ✅ Final Result

```python
return max_len = 3
```

### 🔠 Longest substring without repeating characters is `"wke"` (or `"kew"`) of length **3**.

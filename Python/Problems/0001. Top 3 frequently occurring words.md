# Top 3 frequently occurring words in python

```python
from collections import Counter
import re

text = """
We had a huge response to our last Dagster Running Dagster session, and we’re bringing it back with a focus on event-driven pipelines and real-time observability.
Dagster engineer Nick Roach (with Alex Noonan & Colton Padden) will walk through how we orchestrate millions of daily events with real-time observability using Dagster+.

# Normalize text: lowercase & remove punctuation
words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text.lower())

# Count word frequency
word_counts = Counter(words)

# Get top 3 words
top_3 = word_counts.most_common(3)

print(top_3)
```

**Explanation:**

1. `re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text.lower())` → extracts all words ignoring case.
2. `Counter(words)` → counts occurrences of each word.
3. `most_common(3)` → returns top 3 frequent words with counts.

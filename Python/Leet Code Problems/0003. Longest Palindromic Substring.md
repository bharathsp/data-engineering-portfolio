## 🔁 Longest Palindromic Substring

> Given a string `s`, return the **longest palindromic substring** in `s`.

> 🧠 A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters which reads the same backward as forward.

---

### 🔍 Examples

#### ✅ Example 1:
```
Input:  s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
```
💡 **Explanation**: `"aba"` is also a valid answer.

---

#### ✅ Example 2:
```
Input:  s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

---

### 📌 Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of only digits and English letters.

## 🚀 Optimal Python Solution (Expand Around Center)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        def expandAroundCenter(left: int, right: int) -> str:
            while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
                left -= 1
                right += 1
            return s[left + 1:right]  # substring after expanding

        longest = ""
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # Odd length palindrome
            substr1 = expandAroundCenter(i, i)
            # Even length palindrome
            substr2 = expandAroundCenter(i, i + 1)
            # Choose the longer one
            if len(substr1) > len(longest):
                longest = substr1
            if len(substr2) > len(longest):
                longest = substr2

        return longest
```

### 🧠 How It Works

- For every character, treat it as the **center** of a potential palindrome.
- Expand outwards in both directions (`left`, `right`) to check for valid palindromes.
- Check both:
  - 🔹 Odd-length centers: `expandAroundCenter(i, i)`
  - 🔸 Even-length centers: `expandAroundCenter(i, i + 1)`
- Keep track of the **longest** one found.

### ⏱️ Time Complexity

- **Time:** O(n²)
- **Space:** O(1)

## 📊 Variables

| Variable       | Purpose                                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `longest`      | Stores the current longest palindromic substring |
| `i`            | Current index used as a center              |
| `left, right`  | Bounds that expand out to check palindrome  |

## ✅ Final Result

```python
return "bab"
```

> Note: `"aba"` would also be a valid answer if found first.


| i | Center | Odd Palindrome | Even Palindrome | Longest So Far |

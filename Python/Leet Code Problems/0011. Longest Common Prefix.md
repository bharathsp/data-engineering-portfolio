### ✅ Longest Common Prefix

We need to find the **longest common starting substring** among all the strings in the list.  
If there's no common prefix, return `""`.

### 💡 Approach: Vertical Scanning

Compare characters **column by column (vertically)**:
- Start from the first character of each word.
- If all characters in a column match → continue.
- If mismatch or any string ends → return the prefix so far.

### 🧪 Examples:

```python
Input: ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
Output: "fl"

Input: ["dog", "racecar", "car"]
Output: ""
```

### 🧠 Python Code:

```python
def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    # Loop through characters of the first string
    for i in range(len(strs[0])):
        char = strs[0][i]
        
        # Check this character with the same position in other strings
        for word in strs[1:]:
            if i >= len(word) or word[i] != char:
                return strs[0][:i]
    
    return strs[0]  # All characters matched
```

### 🕵️‍♂️ Step-by-step for `["flower", "flow", "flight"]`:

- Compare `f` → all match ✅
- Compare `l` → all match ✅
- Compare `o` → `flight` has `i` ❌
- Return prefix `"fl"`

### ⏱️ Time Complexity:

- **O(S)** where S is the sum of all characters in all strings — in the worst case.
- Efficient for small strings (under 200 as per constraints).

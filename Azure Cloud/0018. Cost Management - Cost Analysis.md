### üîç **What you can do in Cost Analysis**

1. **View Spend by Different Dimensions**

   * **Subscription** ‚Äì see spend per subscription.
   * **Resource group** ‚Äì break down by project/team.
   * **Service/Resource type** ‚Äì e.g., Virtual Machines, Storage, Databases.
   * **Location/Region** ‚Äì where resources are deployed.
   * **Tags** ‚Äì if you use tagging (like `Dept=Finance`, `Env=Prod`), you can slice spend by business unit.

2. **Explore Usage & Costs**

   * See **daily/monthly/accumulated costs**.
   * Compare **actual vs. budget**.
   * Identify **spikes in spend** and what caused them.
   * Drill down into **resource-level costs** (e.g., which VM or database is consuming the most).

3. **Charts & Visualizations**

   * Line, bar, area charts, pie charts for cost distribution.
   * Accumulated cost (running total).
   * Forecast graphs (Azure predicts your likely spend for the month).

4. **Forecasting**

   * Based on historical data, Azure estimates your **projected cost** until end of billing cycle.

5. **Budgets & Alerts Integration**

   * You can set a **budget** (e.g., $500/month for a project).
   * Get **alerts** if costs approach or exceed the budget.

6. **Granularity**

   * Daily or monthly views.
   * Drill down to individual resources (e.g., one specific VM or storage account).

7. **Export & Automation**

   * Export data to **Excel/CSV**.
   * Automate exports to a **storage account** for reporting pipelines.
   * Connect to **Power BI** for richer dashboards.

### ‚úÖ **When to use Cost Analysis**

* To **monitor and optimize** spend in real-time (not just after invoice).
* To **allocate costs internally** (by department, project, customer).
* To **catch unexpected charges early** (e.g., someone left a large VM running).
* To **plan and forecast** future spend.

üëâ So in short:

* **Invoices = official bills** (accounting, payments).
* **Cost Analysis = interactive reporting tool** (monitoring, optimization, forecasting).

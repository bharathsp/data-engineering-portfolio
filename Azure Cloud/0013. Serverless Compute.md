# 🌟 1. What is Serverless Compute?

* **Serverless compute** means you run code **without managing servers**.
* You don’t worry about provisioning, scaling, or maintaining servers.
* The cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) automatically:
  ✅ Allocates compute resources
  ✅ Scales up/down based on demand
  ✅ Charges you only for **actual usage** (per request, per second, per GB-second)

⚡ **Key Idea** → *You focus on writing code; the cloud takes care of infrastructure.*

# 🌟 2. How It Works

1. You write a function (e.g., process an image, handle a web request).
2. Deploy it to a serverless platform (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, GCP Cloud Functions).
3. The function is **triggered by an event** (HTTP request, database update, file upload, etc.).
4. Cloud spins up resources only when needed → runs → shuts down.

---

# 🌟 3. Example: AWS Lambda

```python
def handler(event, context):
    name = event.get("name", "World")
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

* Deploy this function to **AWS Lambda**.
* Trigger: API Gateway HTTP request `/hello?name=Bharath`
* Execution: Runs only when called
* Billing: Only for **milliseconds of runtime + memory used**

# 🌟 4. Advantages

* 🚀 **No server management**
* 💰 **Pay per use** (no idle cost)
* 📈 **Auto-scaling** (handles 1 request or 1 million)
* ⚡ **Faster development** (focus on business logic)

---

# 🌟 5. Limitations

* ⏳ **Cold starts** (first request may be slow after idle time)
* ⏱️ Limited execution time (e.g., AWS Lambda max 15 mins)
* 📦 Stateless (no in-memory persistence between calls → need DB/storage)
* 🔒 Vendor lock-in (functions tied to provider’s ecosystem)

---

# 🌟 6. Real-Life Analogy

* Traditional compute = **owning a restaurant 🍽️** → you hire staff, pay rent even when empty.
* Serverless compute = **food truck 🚚** → only open when customers come, pay for ingredients + time used.

---

# 🌟 7. Use Cases

* Event-driven applications
* REST APIs & microservices
* Image/video processing
* IoT event handling
* Scheduled jobs (cron replacement)

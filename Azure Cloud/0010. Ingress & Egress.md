## **1. In Networking / Cloud Context** 🌐

| Term        | Icon | Meaning                                              | Example                                                       |
| ----------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ingress** | ⬅️📥 | Data **coming into** a network/system from outside.  | A user uploads a file from their laptop to your cloud server. |
| **Egress**  | ➡️📤 | Data **going out** from a network/system to outside. | Your server sends a report to a client’s email.               |

💡 **Think:**

* **Ingress** → “Incoming”
* **Egress** → “Exiting”

## **2. In Data Engineering Pipelines** 🏭

* **Ingress** → The process of **bringing raw data into** your system (e.g., from FTP, APIs, IoT devices into HDFS or a database).
* **Egress** → The process of **sending processed data out** of your system (e.g., exporting to BI tools, APIs, or another database).

**Pipeline Example:**

```
⬅️ Ingress: IoT sensors → Kafka → HDFS
➡️ Egress: HDFS → Spark → Tableau dashboard
```

## **3. In Cloud Costing (AWS, Azure, GCP)** 💰

* **Ingress** is usually **free** (uploading data to cloud).
* **Egress** often **costs money** (downloading or transferring data out of cloud to the internet).

Example (AWS S3 pricing):

* Upload 1 TB → \$0 (Ingress)
* Download 1 TB → Pay per GB (Egress fee)

## Unity Catalog

**Unity Catalog** is a unified **data governance and cataloging** solution developed by **Databricks**. It provides a **centralized system** for managing **metadata, access control, auditing**, and **data lineage** across all **workspaces and data assets** (e.g., tables, files, machine learning models, etc.) in the **Databricks Lakehouse Platform**.

### üîë **Key Features of Unity Catalog:**

1. **Centralized Metadata Management**

   * Stores metadata (schemas, tables, views, etc.) in one place.
   * Shared across multiple Databricks workspaces.

2. **Fine-Grained Access Control**

   * Implements access at the **table**, **column**, or **row level**.
   * Uses standard SQL `GRANT` and `REVOKE` commands.

3. **Data Lineage**

   * Automatically tracks how data flows from one table to another.
   * Helps in understanding transformations and auditing.

4. **Unified Governance**

   * Governs structured (tables), semi-structured (JSON, Parquet), and unstructured (images, PDFs) data across clouds.
   * Enforces consistent policies across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

5. **Audit Logging**

   * Tracks who accessed what data and when.
   * Useful for compliance and security.

6. **Support for External Locations and Volumes**

   * Manages access to data stored in external locations like S3, ADLS, and GCS.

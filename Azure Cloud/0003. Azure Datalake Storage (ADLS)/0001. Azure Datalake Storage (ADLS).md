**Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)** is a scalable and secure data lake service from Microsoft Azure, built specifically for **big data analytics**.

It is designed to **store massive volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data** in its native format, and make it accessible for processing using tools like Azure Synapse, Databricks, HDInsight, and other big data and analytics platforms.

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Azure Data Lake Storage

There are **two generations**:

1. **ADLS Gen1** *(now deprecated)*
2. **ADLS Gen2** *(currently recommended)* â€“ built on top of Azure Blob Storage with added hierarchical namespace and Hadoop compatibility.

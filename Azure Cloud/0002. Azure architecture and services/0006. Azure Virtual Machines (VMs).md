# 🖥 Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

Azure VMs are **virtualized servers** in the cloud.
They provide **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** — giving you full control over the OS and software without worrying about physical hardware.

---

## ⚙ Key Features

* 🖥 **Full control** of the OS
* 🛠 **Run custom software**
* 🏗 **Use custom hosting configurations**
* 📦 **Images** → Prebuilt templates (OS + optional software) to quickly create VMs

👉 You manage **updates, patches, and software**, while Azure handles **hardware and infrastructure**.

## 📏 Scaling VMs in Azure

### 1️⃣ **Single VMs**

* For testing, dev, or small tasks.

### 2️⃣ **VM Scale Sets**

* 👥 Group of identical, load-balanced VMs.
* Azure automatically:

  * ⚖️ Distributes traffic (load balancer)
  * 📈 Scales up/down based on demand or schedule
* Ideal for **big data, compute-intensive, or container workloads**.

📊 Example: Website with traffic spikes (scale sets add/remove VMs automatically).

### 3️⃣ **VM Availability Sets**

* Ensures **high availability & resiliency** by spreading VMs across:

  * 🔄 **Update domains** → Only some VMs reboot at a time during updates
  * ⚡ **Fault domains** → VMs placed across different power sources & network switches
* ✅ Protects against hardware/network failures
* 💰 No extra cost → You only pay for the VMs

---

## 🎯 Use Cases for VMs

* 🧪 **Testing & Development** → Quickly spin up different OS/app configs, delete when done
* 🌐 **Run apps in the cloud** → Pay only when VMs are running, scale on demand
* 🏢 **Extend datacenter** → Add Azure VMs to your virtual network (e.g., host SharePoint)
* 🛡 **Disaster Recovery** → Run critical apps on Azure VMs if your datacenter fails
* 🚀 **Lift & Shift** → Move existing physical/VM servers to Azure with minimal changes

## 🗂 VM Resources You Configure

When creating a VM, you choose:

* 📏 **Size** → CPU cores, RAM (performance/cost tradeoff)
* 💾 **Storage Disks** → HDDs, SSDs for OS & data
* 🌐 **Networking** → Virtual network, IPs, ports, security

---

* 🖥 **VM** → Virtual server in the cloud (IaaS)
* 📦 **Image** → Template for quick VM creation
* ⚖️ **Scale Sets** → Auto-scaling, load-balanced VM groups
* 🔄 **Availability Sets** → Resiliency with update/fault domains
* 🎯 **Use cases** → Dev/Test, apps, DR, datacenter extension, lift & shift

# 🌐 Azure Physical Infrastructure

Azure’s backbone consists of **datacenters**, grouped into **regions**, **availability zones**, **region pairs**, and sometimes **sovereign regions**.

---

## 🏢 Datacenters

* Large buildings with racks of servers, storage, networking, power, and cooling.
* Foundation of Azure’s physical infrastructure.

(Power, Cooling, Networking)

---

## 📍 Regions

* A **geographical area** containing one or more datacenters.
* Connected with **low-latency networks**.
* Example: *East US, West Europe, Southeast Asia*.

(Global → Region with datacenters)

👉 You choose a **region** when deploying most Azure resources.

---

## 🏛 Availability Zones (AZs)

* **Physically separate datacenters** inside a region.
* Independent **power, cooling, and networking**.
* Provide **isolation**—if one goes down, others stay up.
* Connected via **high-speed fiber**.

🗺 Region
 ↳ 🏢 (AZ1)
 ↳ 🏢 (AZ2)
 ↳ 🏢 (AZ3)

**Types of services in AZs**:

* 📌 *Zonal* → tied to a specific zone (VMs, disks).
* 🔄 *Zone-redundant* → auto replicated (Storage, SQL).
* 🌍 *Non-regional* → always available globally (DNS, Entra ID).

---

## 🔁 Region Pairs

* Most regions are **paired** with another region, \~300 miles apart.
* Protects against **natural disasters, power failures, civil unrest**.
* Example:

  * West US ↔ East US
  * Southeast Asia ↔ East Asia

🌍 Geography
 ↳ 📍 Region A ⟷ 📍 Region B

**Benefits**:
✔ Disaster recovery
✔ Sequential updates (one region at a time)
✔ Data residency laws

---

## 🛡 Sovereign Regions

* **Isolated Azure instances** for legal/compliance needs.
* Examples:

  * 🇺🇸 US Gov regions (DoD Central, Gov Virginia)
  * 🇨🇳 China East, China North (via 21Vianet)

🔒 Region with extra security & compliance controls.

* 🏢 **Datacenters** → Physical facilities with servers.
* 📍 **Regions** → Geographic group of datacenters.
* 🏛 **Availability Zones** → Independent datacenters inside regions.
* 🔁 **Region Pairs** → Two regions for redundancy & disaster recovery.
* 🛡 **Sovereign Regions** → Isolated regions for compliance/government use.

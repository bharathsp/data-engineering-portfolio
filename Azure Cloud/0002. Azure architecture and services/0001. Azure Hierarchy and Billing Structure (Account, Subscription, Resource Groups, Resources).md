# 🔹 Azure Hierarchy and Billing Structure

## 1️⃣ **Azure Account**

* The **top-level identity** in Azure (usually tied to your email/Microsoft account).
* You need an **Azure account** before you can create anything.
* An account can have **multiple subscriptions**.
  👉 Example: `bharath@contoso.com` is the Azure account owner.

---

## 2️⃣ **Azure Subscription**

* A **logical container** for resources.
* Defines **limits, access control, and billing boundaries**.
* Each subscription is billed separately.
  👉 Example:

  * Subscription 1: *Development*
  * Subscription 2: *Production*
  * Subscription 3: *Marketing*

---

## 3️⃣ **Resource Groups**

* A **logical container inside a subscription**.
* Groups related resources together for management (lifecycle, permissions, cost).
* You can **deploy, monitor, or delete** resources as a group.
  👉 Example:

  * Resource Group: *E-commerceApp-RG*
  * Contains: VM, Database, Storage Account, Web App

---

## 4️⃣ **Resources**

* The **actual services** you use inside Azure.
* Examples: Virtual Machines, SQL Databases, Storage Accounts, Web Apps.
  👉 Example: `Ecom-VM01`, `Ecom-SQL01`.

---

## 5️⃣ **Billing Structure**

Within billing, Azure introduces **Billing Accounts, Invoice Sections, and Profiles**:

* **Billing Account**: The **top-level container for billing** (linked to your organization or agreement with Microsoft).
* **Billing Profile**: Represents an **invoice** — defines *who gets billed and how they pay*.

  * Each profile generates **one invoice**.
* **Invoice Section**: Used to **split invoices into multiple parts** (like cost centers or departments).
* **Multiple Invoices in same Billing Account**:

  * You can create multiple **billing profiles** under the same billing account.
  * Each profile can have its own **payment method and invoice**.

👉 Example:

* **Billing Account: Contoso Ltd.**

  * Billing Profile 1 → *Marketing Invoice* (goes to Marketing team)
  * Billing Profile 2 → *Development Invoice* (goes to DevOps team)
  * Each billing profile can have **Invoice Sections** (say, splitting DevOps costs into *Test* vs *Prod*).

✅ **Quick Analogy**:
Think of it like a **shopping mall** 🏬:

* **Azure Account** → The mall owner.
* **Subscription** → Different stores inside the mall (grocery, clothing, electronics).
* **Resource Group** → Departments inside one store (clothing → menswear, womenswear).
* **Resources** → Individual items (a shirt, a laptop).
* **Billing Account** → Mall’s central finance office.
* **Billing Profiles** → Different invoices (rent for grocery, rent for clothing).
* **Invoice Sections** → Breaking one store’s rent into *electricity cost*, *space rent*, etc.

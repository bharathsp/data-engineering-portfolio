# ⚡ Azure Functions

**Azure Functions** is an **event-driven, serverless compute service** in Azure.
Instead of keeping VMs or containers running, **functions only execute when triggered by an event**, and Azure automatically takes care of provisioning, scaling, and managing resources.

## 🖥️ What is Serverless Computing?

* **Serverless = No infrastructure management** → you focus only on writing code.
* Resources are allocated **only when events occur**.
* Automatically **scales up or down** with demand.
* You pay only for **execution time (per CPU/memory used)**, not idle time.

## 🎯 Benefits of Azure Functions

* 🚀 **Event-driven**: Triggered by REST requests, timers, or messages from Azure services.
* 💸 **Cost-efficient**: Pay only for actual runtime, not for idle servers.
* ⚖️ **Auto-scaling**: Handles variable demand without manual intervention.
* 🔄 **Stateless or Stateful**:

  * **Stateless** (default) → function restarts fresh on every trigger.
  * **Durable Functions** → state is preserved across function executions (for workflows, chaining, long-running tasks).
* 🔒 **Flexible deployment**: Can run serverless, on VMs, inside virtual networks, or isolated environments if needed.
* 🛠️ **Supports any code** → write in multiple languages (C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, PowerShell, etc.).

## ⚡ Common Use Cases

* Processing **messages from a queue or event hub**.
* Running tasks on a **schedule** (like a cron job).
* Responding to **HTTP REST API calls**.
* Real-time **file or data processing** (e.g., image resize after upload).
* **Orchestrating workflows** using Durable Functions.

## 📌 In Short

Azure Functions let you:

* **Write code → set a trigger → run only when needed.**
* Forget about provisioning servers or containers.
* Pay only for what you use.

It’s an **ideal choice for lightweight, event-driven, and scalable workloads** in the cloud.

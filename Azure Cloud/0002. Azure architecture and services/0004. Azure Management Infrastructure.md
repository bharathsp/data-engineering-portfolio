# 🛠 Azure Management Infrastructure

The management infrastructure organizes **how you control, group, and govern resources** in Azure.
It follows a **hierarchical structure**:

---

## 🔹 1. Azure Resources

* The **smallest building block** in Azure.
* Examples:

  * 💻 Virtual Machine (VM)
  * 🌐 Virtual Network
  * 📊 Database
  * 🤖 Cognitive Service

👉 Anything you **create, provision, or deploy** in Azure is a resource.

---

## 📦 2. Resource Groups

* A **container** for resources.
* One resource **must belong to one resource group** (not multiple).
* Actions on a group affect **all resources inside** (delete, access, policies).

📦 Resource Group
 ↳ 💻 VM
 ↳ 📊 Database
 ↳ 📱 App
 ↳ 🌐 Virtual Network

👉 Useful for managing related resources (e.g., all resources in a dev environment).

---

## 🧾 3. Subscriptions

* A **unit of management, billing, and scale**.
* Groups multiple resource groups.
* Provides **authenticated access** to Azure services.

Types of **boundaries**:

* 💰 **Billing boundary** → Separate invoices & cost tracking.
* 🔑 **Access control boundary** → Different access policies for different departments/environments.

📜 Subscription
 ↳ 📦 Resource Group 1
 ↳ 📦 Resource Group 2

👉 Example:

* One subscription for **Production** 💼
* One for **Development/Test** 🧪

---

## 🗂 4. Management Groups

* The **top-level container** for organizing subscriptions.
* Helps apply **policies, compliance, and RBAC (role-based access control)** across many subscriptions.
* Can be **nested up to 6 levels**.

🗂 Management Group
 ↳ 📜 Subscription A
  ↳ 📦 Resource Group
   ↳ 💻 Resource
 ↳ 📜 Subscription B
 ↳ 📜 Subscription C

👉 Example use cases:

* Apply policy to **all Production subscriptions** (e.g., restrict to West US only).
* Assign user access **once at management group level**, inherited everywhere below.

# ✅ Summary with Icons

* 💻 **Resources** → Individual services (VMs, DBs, apps).
* 📦 **Resource Groups** → Containers for resources.
* 📜 **Subscriptions** → Logical units for billing & access, group resource groups.
* 🗂 **Management Groups** → Organize multiple subscriptions, apply policies at scale.

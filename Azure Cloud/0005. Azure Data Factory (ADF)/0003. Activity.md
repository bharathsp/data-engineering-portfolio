## Activity

In **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**, an **Activity** is the **smallest unit of execution** in a pipeline. It defines **a single task** to perform, such as copying data, running a stored procedure, executing a data transformation, or controlling flow logic.

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Activities in ADF:

Activities are grouped into **three main categories**:

| **Category**            | **Examples**                                                                   | **Purpose**                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Movement**       | `Copy Activity`                                                                | Moves data from source to sink (e.g., SQL to Blob Storage) |
| **Data Transformation** | `Data Flow`, `HDInsight`, `Databricks`, `Stored Procedure`                     | Transforms or processes data                               |
| **Control Flow**        | `If Condition`, `ForEach`, `Until`, `Wait`, `Set Variable`, `Execute Pipeline` | Manages pipeline logic and workflow                        |

### ðŸ”§ Example Use Cases of Activities:

| **Activity**              | **Use Case**                                                   |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Copy Activity**         | Transfer data from an on-premise SQL Server to Azure Blob      |
| **Data Flow Activity**    | Cleanse and transform data using mapping data flows            |
| **Lookup Activity**       | Fetch configuration or metadata before processing              |
| **If Condition Activity** | Check a value or status and run different branches accordingly |
| **ForEach Activity**      | Loop through a list of files or records and process each one   |
| **Web Activity**          | Call REST APIs to trigger external services                    |
| **Execute Pipeline**      | Run another pipeline from within the current one               |

### ðŸ“Œ Summary:

* **Activity** = one task or action within a pipeline.
* A **pipeline** is made up of **multiple activities** executed in sequence or parallel.
* Activities **consume datasets**, **use linked services**, and can be **parameterized**.
* Each activity has its own **execution status**, which is visible in **monitoring**.

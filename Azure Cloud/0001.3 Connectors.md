## Connectors

In **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**, **Connectors** are **prebuilt interfaces** that allow ADF to connect to and interact with various **data sources and destinations** (on-premises and cloud-based). They are defined through **Linked Services** in ADF and are essential for enabling **data ingestion, movement, and transformation** across diverse platforms.

### üîó What Are Connectors?

* Think of connectors as **bridges** between ADF and your **data storage or compute systems**.
* ADF supports **over 90+ connectors**, making it highly versatile for **ETL/ELT** workflows.

### üîπ Types of ADF Connectors

| **Category**                  | **Examples**                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Azure Services**            | Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1/Gen2, Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Analytics, Cosmos DB |
| **Databases (Cloud/On-Prem)** | SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Teradata, DB2, SAP HANA                                                |
| **Big Data and Analytics**    | Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, Hive, HDFS                                                 |
| **SaaS Applications**         | Salesforce, Dynamics 365, Google Analytics, ServiceNow, SharePoint                                            |
| **File-based**                | FTP, SFTP, HTTP, Amazon S3, Excel, CSV, JSON, XML                                                             |

### üõ†Ô∏è How Are Connectors Used?

1. **Linked Services**: Connectors are configured via **Linked Services**, where you define connection details (host, port, credentials).
2. **Datasets**: Point to data structures (like tables, files) within those linked services.
3. **Activities**: Use these datasets to perform operations (copy, transform, look up, etc.).

---

### üîí Security

* Supports **Key Vault integration** for storing credentials securely.
* Options for **Managed Identity**, **OAuth**, **Basic Auth**, or **Service Principal** depending on the connector.

---

### üìå Example Use Case

If you're copying data from an **on-prem SQL Server** to **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**:

* Use the **SQL Server connector** for the source.
* Use the **ADLS Gen2 connector** for the sink (destination).
* Define both as **Linked Services**.
* Create datasets that reference tables and file locations.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

* **Connectors in ADF** enable integration with a wide range of **data platforms**.
* Used through **Linked Services** and **Datasets**.
* Let you **ingest**, **transform**, and **load data** across hybrid environments securely.

**Azure Data Factory (ADF)** is a **cloud-based data integration and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service** provided by Microsoft Azure.

---

### 🔷 **Key Purpose of Azure Data Factory**

It is used to:

* **Move**, **transform**, and **orchestrate** data across different data sources and destinations — both **on-premises and in the cloud**.
* Build **automated data pipelines** to prepare data for analytics, reporting, or machine learning.

---

### 💡 **Why Use Azure Data Factory?**

* Connect to 90+ **data sources** (SQL, Blob Storage, REST APIs, SAP, Snowflake, etc.)
* Handle **ETL** and **ELT** scenarios
* Visually build workflows (no/low-code)
* Schedule **batch jobs** or run **trigger-based workflows**
* Manage and monitor data pipelines with ease

### 🧱 **Core Components of ADF**

| Component                    | Description                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pipeline**                 | A logical group of activities that perform a task (e.g., ingest, transform, copy data). |
| **Activity**                 | A step within a pipeline (e.g., Copy, Execute Data Flow, Web call).                     |
| **Data Flow**                | A visual data transformation UI (drag-and-drop).                                        |
| **Linked Service**           | Connection info to external systems (like SQL Server, Blob Storage).                    |
| **Dataset**                  | Represents data structure pointing to or from a data store.                             |
| **Trigger**                  | Defines when a pipeline should run (scheduled, tumbling window, event-based).           |
| **Integration Runtime (IR)** | The compute infrastructure used to run activities (can be Azure-hosted or self-hosted). |

+------------------+      +--------------------+      +------------------+
| Data Sources     | ---> | Azure Data Factory | ---> | Destination (e.g.|
| (SQL, API, Blob) |      |  (Pipelines)       |      | SQL DB, Lake, BI)|
+------------------+      +--------------------+      +------------------+
```

### ✅ **Typical Use Cases**

1. **Data Migration**: Move on-premises data to Azure.
2. **Data Transformation**: Clean, enrich, join, or filter raw data using **Mapping Data Flows**.
3. **Data Orchestration**: Run complex workflows across systems and time schedules.
4. **Big Data Prep**: Prepare data for analytics in **Azure Synapse**, **Power BI**, or **Azure ML**.

---

### 📊 **Real-Life Example**

**Scenario**: A company wants to:

* Pull data from an on-premises SQL Server every night
* Transform it (clean, filter, calculate columns)
* Store it in Azure Data Lake
* Trigger a Power BI dashboard refresh

**ADF Pipeline** automates this entire workflow with scheduling, monitoring, and error handling.

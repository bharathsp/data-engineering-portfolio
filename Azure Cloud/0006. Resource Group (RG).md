### ðŸ”¹ Purpose of a Resource Group

It helps you **organize, manage, and control** resources that share a **common lifecycle**â€”such as deployment, update, and deletion.

### ðŸ”¹ Example Use Case

Letâ€™s say youâ€™re building a web application.

You can place the following in one resource group:

* Azure App Service (for hosting)
* Azure SQL Database (for data)
* Azure Storage Account (for media files)
* Azure Key Vault (for secrets)
* Application Insights (for monitoring)

Now you can manage all these as **one unit**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Best Practices

* Group resources that share the **same lifecycle**.
* Donâ€™t mix **production** and **development** resources in the same group.
* Apply **tags** to resource groups for billing, environment, or ownership clarity.
* Use **role-based access** to control who can manage resources in each group.

### ðŸ”¹ Visual Analogy

Think of a **resource group** like a folder on your computer. You keep all project-related files in that folder so they are easy to manage, move, or delete together.

**Azure Machine Learning Studio** (commonly referred to as **ML Studio**) is a **cloud-based environment** provided by Microsoft for **building, training, and deploying machine learning models** quickly and easilyâ€”**without deep programming knowledge**.

There are **two versions**:

1. **Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)** â€“ Drag-and-drop interface (legacy, not recommended for new projects)
2. **Azure Machine Learning Studio (new/modern)** â€“ Part of **Azure Machine Learning service**, offers code-first and low-code/visual interfaces

### ðŸ”¹ What Can You Do in ML Studio?

| Task                            | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Build ML models**             | Use drag-and-drop designer or Jupyter notebooks                  |
| **Train models**                | Train using built-in algorithms or custom scripts                |
| **Deploy models**               | Deploy as REST APIs to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), ACI, etc. |
| **Manage ML lifecycle**         | Track experiments, model versions, and metrics                   |
| **Automated ML (AutoML)**       | Automatically trains multiple models and picks the best one      |
| **Data labeling & preparation** | Label datasets and preprocess them                               |
| **MLOps**                       | Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for production-ready ML           |

### ðŸ”¹ Example Workflow in ML Studio

1. Upload a dataset (e.g., CSV file)
2. Clean and transform data (e.g., handle missing values)
3. Choose an algorithm (e.g., classification)
4. Train and evaluate the model
5. Deploy it as a web service
6. Call it from an app via REST API

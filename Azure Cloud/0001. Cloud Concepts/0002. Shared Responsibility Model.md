# 🛡️ **What is the Shared Responsibility Model?**

The **Shared Responsibility Model** in cloud computing defines **which security and operational responsibilities belong to the cloud provider** and **which remain with you (the customer)**.

👉 It’s not “the cloud is secure” but **“security *in* the cloud” is a shared job**.

# 🏢 **Traditional Datacenter (On-Premises)**

In a **corporate datacenter**:

* Company owns and manages **everything**:

  * Physical space, security, power, cooling.
  * Servers, storage, networking.
  * Operating systems, applications, patches.
  * Data security and access controls.

⚠️ 100% responsibility = on the company.

# ☁️ **In the Cloud**

With cloud computing, **responsibilities are split**:

### ✅ Cloud Provider is always responsible for:

* Physical datacenter 🏢 (power, cooling, building security).
* Physical hosts 💻 (servers, racks).
* Physical networking 🌐 (cables, switches).

### ✅ Customer is always responsible for:

* Information and data 🔒.
* Devices that connect (laptops, phones, IoT).
* Accounts, identities, and access 👥.

### 🌓 Shared (depends on service model):

* Operating system updates.
* Network controls.
* Applications.
* Middleware and runtime.

# ⚙️ **By Service Model**

### 1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

* Provider: Hardware, virtualization, physical infra.
* Customer: OS, applications, patches, data.
* Example: **Azure VMs, AWS EC2**.

### 2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

* Provider: Infra + OS + runtime + DB software.
* Customer: Data, access, and apps built on top.
* Example: **Azure SQL Database, AWS RDS, Google App Engine**.

### 3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

* Provider: Almost everything (infra, OS, application, security).
* Customer: Only data, access, and identity.
* Example: **Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Gmail**.

# 🖼️ **Analogy**

Think of it like **renting a house**:

* **On-premises** 🏡 → You build the house, do all maintenance, secure it, pay for utilities.
* **IaaS** 🔨 → Landlord provides the house structure; you handle furniture, locks, upkeep.
* **PaaS** 🏠 → Landlord provides a fully-furnished house; you just bring your belongings.
* **SaaS** 🛏️ → Hotel stay; landlord handles everything, you only secure your personal items.

# 📊 **Summary Table**

| Responsibility         | On-Premises | IaaS     | PaaS     | SaaS     |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Physical datacenter    | Customer    | Provider | Provider | Provider |
| Networking (hardware)  | Customer    | Provider | Provider | Provider |
| Servers/virtualization | Customer    | Provider | Provider | Provider |
| Operating system       | Customer    | Customer | Provider | Provider |

# ✅ **Key Takeaway**

* You **always** own: **data, devices, identities**.
* Cloud provider **always** owns: **physical infra & networking**.
* Responsibility for OS, applications, and runtime shifts depending on **IaaS, PaaS, SaaS**.

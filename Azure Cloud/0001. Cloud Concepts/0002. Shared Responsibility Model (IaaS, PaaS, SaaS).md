# 🛡️ **What is the Shared Responsibility Model?**

The **Shared Responsibility Model** in cloud computing defines **which security and operational responsibilities belong to the cloud provider** and **which remain with you (the customer)**.

👉 It’s not “the cloud is secure” but **“security *in* the cloud” is a shared job**.

# 🏢 **Traditional Datacenter (On-Premises)**

In a **corporate datacenter**:

* Company owns and manages **everything**:

  * Physical space, security, power, cooling.
  * Servers, storage, networking.
  * Operating systems, applications, patches.
  * Data security and access controls.

⚠️ 100% responsibility = on the company.

# ☁️ **In the Cloud**

With cloud computing, **responsibilities are split**:

### ✅ Cloud Provider is always responsible for:

* Physical datacenter 🏢 (power, cooling, building security).
* Physical hosts 💻 (servers, racks).
* Physical networking 🌐 (cables, switches).

### ✅ Customer is always responsible for:

* Information and data 🔒.
* Devices that connect (laptops, phones, IoT).
* Accounts, identities, and access 👥.

### 🌓 Shared (depends on service model):

* Operating system updates.
* Network controls.
* Applications.
* Middleware and runtime.

# ⚙️ **By Service Model**

### 1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

IaaS provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources. In an IaaS model, the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security. You’re responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration; and so on. With IaaS, you’re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you.

* Provider: Hardware, virtualization, physical infra.
* Customer: OS, applications, patches, data.
* Example: **Azure VMs, AWS EC2**.

📌 **Scenarios:**

* **Startups building custom apps** → A small company rents virtual machines (VMs) and storage on Azure/AWS instead of buying servers.
* **Disaster recovery setup** → An enterprise sets up backup VMs in Azure to quickly restore business operations if the on-premises datacenter fails.
* **Testing & development** → A dev team spins up test environments (VMs, databases) on demand, and deletes them when testing is done to save costs.
* **Lift-and-shift migration** → You’re setting up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simply moving the things running on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure.
* **Testing and development** → You have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate. You can start up or shut down the different environments rapidly with an IaaS structure, while maintaining complete control.

### 2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.

* Provider: Infra + OS + runtime + DB software.
* Customer: Data, access, and apps built on top.
* Example: **Azure SQL Database, AWS RDS, Google App Engine**.

📌 **Scenarios:**

* **Web application development** → A developer builds and deploys an app on Azure App Service without worrying about OS patches or load balancing.
* **Data analytics** → A data engineer uses Azure Synapse or AWS Redshift to run analytics without managing servers or clusters.
* **Event-driven apps** → Using Azure Functions or AWS Lambda, developers write business logic, and the platform automatically handles scaling.

### 3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

Software as a service (SaaS) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. With SaaS, you’re essentially renting or using a fully developed application. Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation.
While the SaaS model may be the least flexible, it’s also the easiest to get up and running. It requires the least amount of technical knowledge or expertise to fully employ.

* Provider: Almost everything (infra, OS, application, security).
* Customer: Only data, access, and identity.
* Example: **Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Gmail**.

📌 **Scenarios:**

* **Email & collaboration** → A company uses Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, or Slack for communication and productivity.
* **Customer relationship management (CRM)** → A sales team uses Salesforce to manage leads and customer interactions.
* **E-commerce platform** → A small business runs its online shop using Shopify or BigCommerce without worrying about servers or code.

# 🖼️ **Analogy**

Think of it like **renting a house**:

* **On-premises** 🏡 → You build the house, do all maintenance, secure it, pay for utilities.
* **IaaS** 🔨 → Landlord provides the house structure; you handle furniture, locks, upkeep.
* **PaaS** 🏠 → Landlord provides a fully-furnished house; you just bring your belongings.
* **SaaS** 🛏️ → Hotel stay; landlord handles everything, you only secure your personal items.

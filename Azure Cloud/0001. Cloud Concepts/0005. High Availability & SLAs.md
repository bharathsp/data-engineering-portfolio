# ⚡ **High Availability (HA)**

* **Definition:** The ability of a system to remain accessible and operational **even during failures** (hardware crash, network outage, or power loss).
* Goal: **Minimize downtime** and provide continuous service.

### 🔑 How Azure ensures High Availability:

* **Redundancy:** Multiple instances (VMs, disks, regions).
* **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across healthy resources.
* **Failover:** Automatic switch to a healthy backup when one instance fails.
* **Geo-replication:** Data and services spread across regions.

👉 Example: Hosting a web app in **two availability zones** → if Zone 1 goes down, Zone 2 keeps the app running.

# 📜 **Service-Level Agreement (SLA)**

* **Definition:** A formal contract from Azure that guarantees a certain level of **uptime/availability** for a service.
* Expressed as a **percentage of uptime per month/year**.
* If Azure fails to meet the SLA, customers may get **service credits/refunds**.

# 📊 **SLA Percentages Explained**

Let’s compare **99%** vs **99.9%** uptime:

| SLA         | Downtime Allowed per Year | Downtime Allowed per Month | Downtime Allowed per Week |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **99%**     | \~3.65 days               | \~7.2 hours                | \~1.68 hours              |
| **99.9%**   | \~8.76 hours              | \~43.8 minutes             | \~10.1 minutes            |
| **99.99%**  | \~52.6 minutes            | \~4.38 minutes             | \~1 minute                |
| **99.999%** | \~5.26 minutes            | \~26.3 seconds             | \~6 seconds               |

👉 Difference:

* **99% SLA** = \~7 hours downtime each month.
* **99.9% SLA** = only \~44 minutes downtime each month.
  That’s **10x better availability**.

# 🖼️ **Analogy**

Think of **SLA as a train service guarantee** 🚆:

* **99% SLA** → Train may be delayed \~7 hours each month.
* **99.9% SLA** → Train may only be delayed \~44 minutes each month.
  Which one would you trust for daily commuting?

# ✅ **Key Takeaways**

* **High Availability** = system design to minimize downtime.
* **SLA** = Azure’s contractual guarantee of uptime.
* The **extra “9s” in SLA matter a lot** — each one reduces downtime significantly.

## Trigger

In **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**, a **Trigger** is used to **automatically start a pipeline** execution based on a **specific condition or schedule**. Instead of manually running a pipeline, triggers allow you to run it based on **time, events, or dependency logic**.

---

### üîπ What Is a Trigger?

> A **Trigger** is a component in ADF that **launches pipelines** when a **defined condition** is met ‚Äî such as a **schedule**, **event**, or **manual trigger**.

### üîß Types of Triggers in ADF

| **Trigger Type**                         | **Description**                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Schedule Trigger**                     | Runs pipelines on a defined schedule (e.g., every day at 9 AM)                                                    |
| **Event-Based Trigger**                  | Starts pipeline when a file arrives or is deleted in Azure Blob Storage or ADLS                                   |
| **Manual Trigger**                       | Starts pipeline manually through UI, SDK, or REST API                                                             |
| **Tumbling Window Trigger**              | Executes at fixed intervals and captures time-bound data (e.g., hourly batch jobs), supports retry and dependency |
| **Custom Trigger (via REST/PowerShell)** | Triggered externally using API calls or scripts                                                                   |

### üìÖ 1. **Schedule Trigger**

```json
{
  "name": "DailyTrigger",
  "type": "ScheduleTrigger",
  "properties": {
    "recurrence": {
      "frequency": "Day",
      "interval": 1,
      "startTime": "2025-07-13T09:00:00Z"
    },
    "pipelines": [
      {
        "pipelineReference": { "referenceName": "MyPipeline", "type": "PipelineReference" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

### üß† 2. **Event Trigger** (Blob file arrival)

* Monitors a storage location.
* Can trigger pipeline **when a file is created or deleted**.

---

### üß≠ 3. **Tumbling Window Trigger**

* Used in **time-based incremental loading**.
* Supports **retry policies**, **dependency chaining**, and **backfill**.

---

### üõ† How Triggers Work:

1. You create a trigger and associate it with a pipeline.
2. The trigger listens or watches for its defined condition.
3. When the condition is met, ADF starts the associated pipeline(s).
4. You can **monitor trigger runs** in the **ADF Monitor tab**.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| **Component**     | **Purpose**                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trigger**       | Automates pipeline runs based on a condition (time/event/manual) |
| **Pipeline**      | Workflow that defines what tasks to execute                      |
| **Trigger Types** | Schedule, Event-based, Tumbling Window, Manual                   |

---

The **difference between a Scheduled Trigger and a Tumbling Window Trigger** in Azure Data Factory (ADF) lies in how they **manage time**, **data slices**, and **pipeline execution behavior**.

### üîÑ Quick Comparison: Schedule Trigger vs Tumbling Window Trigger

| **Feature**            | **Schedule Trigger**                             | **Tumbling Window Trigger**                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | Run pipelines on a fixed **time schedule**       | Run pipelines on **non-overlapping time intervals** (data slices) |
| **Time Slicing**       | No awareness of time slices or data partitioning | Aware of **windowed time frames** (e.g., hourly, daily)           |
| **Backfill Support**   | ‚ùå Not supported directly                         | ‚úÖ Supports **backfilling** missed windows                         |
| **Dependency Support** | ‚ùå No built-in dependency management              | ‚úÖ Supports **dependency chaining** across pipelines               |
| **Stateful Execution** | Stateless ‚Äî doesn't track previous runs          | Stateful ‚Äî tracks each window run                                 |
| **Retry Policy**       | Basic retry policy                               | Advanced retry per window, supports retries for failed windows    |
| **Example Use Case**   | Daily ETL job at 1 AM                            | Hourly incremental data load from source system                   |

---

### üß≠ Example Use Cases

#### ‚úÖ **Schedule Trigger**:

* "Run my pipeline every day at 2 AM"
* "Trigger data refresh every 6 hours"

#### ‚úÖ **Tumbling Window Trigger**:

* "Process one hour of logs at a time, without overlap"
* "Ingest daily data partitions with recovery from missed days"

---

### üí° Key Concept: Windowing

* **Tumbling Window** creates **non-overlapping, contiguous time intervals**, each treated as a **unit of work**.
* It **passes the window start and end time** as parameters to the pipeline, making it ideal for **time-based data partitioning**.

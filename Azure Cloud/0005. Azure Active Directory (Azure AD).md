**Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** is Microsoft‚Äôs **cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) service**. It helps organizations **securely manage users, groups, and access to applications and resources**‚Äîboth in the cloud and on-premises.

### üîπ Key Functions of Azure AD

| Function                               | Description                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication**                     | Verifies user identity (sign-in to apps, portals, etc.)                                             |
| **Authorization**                      | Grants or denies access to resources based on user roles or policies                                |
| **Single Sign-On (SSO)**               | Allows users to log in once and access multiple apps without re-authenticating                      |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  | Adds extra security by requiring a second form of verification                                      |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**   | Manages who can access what, using roles and permissions                                            |
| **Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)** | Lets users reset their passwords securely without admin help                                        |
| **Conditional Access**                 | Enforces policies like ‚Äúblock login from unknown locations‚Äù or ‚Äúrequire MFA for high-risk sign-ins‚Äù |

### üîπ Common Use Cases

* Employee login to Microsoft 365, Azure Portal, or company apps
* SSO across SaaS apps like Salesforce, Dropbox, ServiceNow, etc.
* Secure API and app access (with OAuth, OpenID Connect)
* Protecting access with MFA and conditional access policies
* B2B and B2C scenarios (partners, customers, external users)

### üîπ Azure AD vs On-Prem Active Directory

| Feature     | Azure Active Directory       | On-Prem Active Directory       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Type        | Cloud-based                  | On-premises                    |
| Protocol    | Modern (OAuth, SAML, OpenID) | Kerberos, LDAP                 |
| Target Use  | Web/mobile/cloud apps        | Traditional LAN environments   |
| Integration | Office 365, Azure, SaaS      | Windows domain joined machines |

*Organizations can synchronize on-prem AD with Azure AD using **Azure AD Connect**.*

### üîπ Example: How It Works

1. User logs in to **Office 365**
2. Azure AD checks credentials
3. If policies are met (e.g., MFA), Azure AD issues a **token**
4. Token allows access to Office 365 apps

### üîê Security Features

* **Conditional Access Policies**
* **Identity Protection (risk-based access)**
* **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** for just-in-time access
* **Audit logs and monitoring**

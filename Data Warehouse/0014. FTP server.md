In **data engineering**, an **FTP server** is basically a **file storage and transfer system** that uses the **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** to let you **upload, download, and manage files** between systems over a network (often the internet).

### **FTP Server in Simple Terms** 📦📤📥

* Imagine it as a **remote folder** on another computer (server) that you can connect to and exchange files with.
* You connect to it using an **FTP client** (like FileZilla, WinSCP, or programmatically via Python, Java, etc.).
* It’s widely used for **moving raw data files** from one place to another.

| 🌐   | **Protocol**            | Uses the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), FTPS (secure FTP), or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).               |
| 📂   | **Data Formats**        | Can store CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet, Excel, logs, etc.                                                          |
| 🔑   | **Authentication**      | Requires a username/password, or sometimes key-based authentication (SFTP).                                   |
| ⏳    | **Batch Data Movement** | Common for periodic (e.g., daily) data dumps.                                                                 |
| 🔄   | **Integration**         | Data pipelines fetch files from FTP servers and load them into data warehouses, lakes, or processing systems. |

### **How it Fits in Data Engineering Pipelines** ⚙️

```
📊 Data Producer (ERP, CRM, Sensors, etc.)
      ⬇ (exports data)
🌐 FTP Server
      ⬇ (fetch with pipeline)
🏭 ETL/ELT Process
      ⬇
📦 Data Warehouse / Data Lake
```

Example:

* A bank uploads daily transaction logs to an **SFTP server**.
* A data engineering job (Airflow, Azure Data Factory, AWS Glue, etc.) connects to the server every night, downloads the files, and loads them into a data lake for processing.

### 🧹 What is **Vacuum Cleaning** in Data Engineering?

In the context of **data lakes**, especially with **Delta Lake**, **Vacuum** is the **process of deleting old, unreferenced data files** that are **no longer needed** by the current or past versions of a table.

---

### 🔧 **Why is Vacuum Needed?**

When you **update**, **delete**, or **merge** data in Delta Lake, the old data files aren’t immediately removed — they’re kept for **Time Travel** and rollback. Over time, this can result in:

* Accumulation of obsolete files
* Increased storage costs
* Slower query performance

**Vacuum cleaning helps reclaim storage and improve performance.**

---

### ✅ **Delta Lake Vacuum Syntax (PySpark):**

```python
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/mnt/delta/my_table")

# Remove files older than 7 days (default retention period)
deltaTable.vacuum()
```

```python
# Optional: Set a custom retention period (in hours)
deltaTable.vacuum(retentionHours=24)  # Deletes files older than 24 hours
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: The default minimum retention is **168 hours (7 days)** to protect against accidental deletion needed for Time Travel.

---

### ⚠️ **Force Vacuum Before 7 Days?**

To bypass the 7-day safety window (not recommended in production unless Time Travel is disabled):

```python
spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.retentionDurationCheck.enabled", "false")
deltaTable.vacuum(0)  # Delete files immediately
```

---

### 🧠 Real-Life Analogy:

Think of Delta Lake as a versioned document editor (like Google Docs):

* Even if you delete content, older versions are saved for recovery.
* **Vacuum** is like clearing the document’s **version history** to free up space — **but only after you're sure you won’t need the old versions anymore.**

---

### 🧪 Example Use Case:

A retail company updates their product pricing daily. After a week:

* They **don’t need to access older versions**
* They run `VACUUM` to clean up old data files and save cloud storage costs

### 📌 Summary:

| Feature           | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Purpose           | Delete old data files no longer needed    |
| Applies to        | Delta Lake (Parquet + transaction logs)   |
| Default Retention | 7 days (168 hours)                        |
| Safe to use?      | Yes, but be cautious if using Time Travel |

# Consider a scenario where I have a delta table and I insert 5 records, next day I insert 2 records, the third day I delete 2 records. How many records do I see when I query the table and how many records would be present in the backend? When does this extra info get removed from the backend? And how can it be removed forcefully?

### **Scenario**

#### **Day 1: Insert 5 records**

* **Query result**: 5 records
* **Backend storage**: 5 Parquet files (or possibly fewer/more depending on partitioning and file sizes).
* **Delta Log (`_delta_log`)** records this as a **transaction commit**.

---

#### **Day 2: Insert 2 more records**

* **Query result**: 7 records (5 + 2).
* **Backend storage**: Files containing first 5 records + new files for 2 records.
* **Delta Log** has a new version (e.g., version 1).
* **Old data files** are still there — no overwrite happened.

---

#### **Day 3: Delete 2 records**

* **Query result**: 5 records (7 − 2 deleted).
* **Backend storage**:

  * **Still has all 7 records physically in old files**.
  * Delete operation marks the deleted rows in the Delta Log metadata, but **doesn’t immediately remove them from disk**.
  * This is because Delta Lake supports **time travel** and rollback — it needs old data to reconstruct older versions.

---

### **Why is the backend bigger than the query result?**

Because Delta Lake **does not overwrite files in place**.

* For delete/update/merge: Delta creates new files without the deleted/updated rows and marks old files as "removed" in the Delta log.
* The "removed" files are still in storage until **vacuum** runs.

---

### **When does the extra data get removed?**

* By default: after **7 days** (configurable) — this is the **retention period** for old snapshots.
* This is to prevent accidental data loss and to allow **time travel**.

---

### **How to remove it forcefully?**

Run:

```sql
VACUUM my_delta_table RETAIN 0 HOURS
```

or in PySpark:

```python
spark.sql("VACUUM my_delta_table RETAIN 0 HOURS")
```

⚠ **Warning**: This permanently deletes old data and disables time travel for that data.

### **Summary Table**

| Day   | Query Result | Backend Record Count | Why Extra Exists?              |
| ----- | ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Day 1 | 5            | 5                    | Fresh insert                   |
| Day 2 | 7            | 7                    | Appended data                  |
| Day 3 | 5            | 7                    | Old files kept for time travel |

---

📌 **Quick Visual**

```
[Day 1]  Files: [A1..A5] -----------------> Query: 5 rows
[Day 2]  Files: [A1..A5, B1..B2] ---------> Query: 7 rows
[Day 3]  Files: [A1..A5, B1..B2] (2 deleted in log) -> Query: 5 rows
            ↑
     Old files physically still exist until VACUUM
```

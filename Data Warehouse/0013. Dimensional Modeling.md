**Dimensional Modelling** in a **Data Warehouse** is a design technique used to structure data in a way that is **optimized for querying and reporting**, especially in **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** systems. It simplifies complex data into a format that makes it easy for users to **analyze trends, patterns, and business metrics**.

### 🧱 Core Concepts of Dimensional Modeling:

Dimensional modeling breaks data into two types of tables:

1. ### **Fact Table** 📊

   * Contains **numeric measures** (facts) that are **aggregated** and **analyzed**.
   * Example: `SalesAmount`, `OrderCount`, `Profit`
   * **Granularity**: Each row represents a measurable event (e.g., a sale).
   * **Foreign keys** to dimension tables.

2. ### **Dimension Table** 📐

   * Contains **descriptive attributes** related to facts for filtering, grouping, and labeling.
   * Example: `Customer`, `Product`, `Date`, `Region`
   * Dimensions give **context** to the numbers in the fact table.

### 🧩 Common Schema Types

#### 1. **Star Schema**

* Fact table in the center connected directly to dimension tables.
* Simple and fast for queries.

#### 2. **Snowflake Schema**

* Normalized form of Star Schema where dimension tables are split into sub-dimensions.
* Reduces redundancy, slightly more complex.

#### 3. **Galaxy Schema (Fact Constellation)**

* Multiple fact tables sharing dimension tables.
* Useful for complex businesses with different processes (e.g., sales and returns).

### 🧾 Example:

Let’s model a **Retail Sales Data Warehouse**:

| 📊 Fact Table – `SalesFact` |            |          |             |              |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| DateKey                     | ProductKey | StoreKey | SalesAmount | QuantitySold |

| 📐 Dimension – `DateDim` |      |       |         |      |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| DateKey                  | Date | Month | Quarter | Year |

| 📐 Dimension – `ProductDim` |             |          |       |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| ProductKey                  | ProductName | Category | Brand |

| 📐 Dimension – `StoreDim` |           |      |        |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ---- | ------ |
| StoreKey                  | StoreName | City | Region |

### ✅ Advantages of Dimensional Modeling:

* **Faster query performance**
* **Easy to understand** for business users
* **Scalable and extendable**
* **Supports OLAP operations** like drill-down, roll-up, slicing, and dicing

---

### 🚫 Limitations:

* Less suited for **highly transactional systems** (use 3NF there)
* Changes in granularity or business process can need rework

### 📦 What is a **Data Mart**?

A **Data Mart** is a **subset of a data warehouse**, focused on a specific **business line, department, or subject area**—such as sales, finance, marketing, or HR.

Think of it as a **mini data warehouse** that is optimized for a specific team's analytical needs.

### 🔍 **Key Characteristics of Data Marts:**

1. **Subject-Oriented**

   * Designed for a specific business area (e.g., Sales, HR).

2. **Subset of Enterprise Data**

   * Contains only the data relevant to that department, extracted from the central data warehouse or other sources.

3. **Faster Access & Simpler Queries**

   * Because of limited scope, queries run faster and are easier to build.

4. **Can Be Independent or Dependent**

   * **Dependent Data Mart**: Created from the centralized data warehouse.
   * **Independent Data Mart**: Built directly from data sources, without a central warehouse.

### 🏗️ **Types of Data Marts:**

| Type            | Description                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Dependent**   | Draws data from a central data warehouse |
| **Independent** | Built directly from source systems       |
| **Hybrid**      | Combines both approaches for flexibility |

### 🛠️ **Data Mart Example:**

Suppose a company has a central data warehouse. The **sales department** may only need access to:

* Regional sales figures
* Sales by product
* Monthly revenue trends

So a **Sales Data Mart** is created to store just that data, enabling faster access and easier reporting for the sales team.

### 💡 **Why Use Data Marts?**

* Simplifies access to relevant data
* Improves query performance
* Reduces data volume for users
* Easier to maintain for individual departments
* Enables role-based access control

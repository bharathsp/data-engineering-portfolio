## 📌 What is **Kafka Offset**?

👉 In **Apache Kafka**, an **offset** is like a **bookmark (📖)** that keeps track of the position of a consumer in a **partition**.

Each message in a Kafka **topic partition** has a unique, sequential number → this is the **offset**.
Offsets start at **0** and increase by **1** for every new message.

---

## 🎯 Why is Offset Important?

* ✅ Ensures **messages are read in order** from a partition.
* ✅ Helps consumers know **where they left off**.
* ✅ Enables **reprocessing or skipping** messages if needed.
* ✅ Allows **multiple consumers** in a group to track their own progress independently.

---

## 🛠️ Example Use Case

Let’s say we have a **Kafka Topic: `Orders`** with 1 partition.

📦 Partition 0 contains messages:

| Offset | Message     |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 0      | OrderID=101 |
| 1      | OrderID=102 |
| 2      | OrderID=103 |
| 3      | OrderID=104 |

Now, a consumer (🧑‍💻 Consumer A) is reading:

* If **offset = 0**, it reads `OrderID=101`.
* If **offset = 2**, it reads `OrderID=103`.
* Once it reads a message, Kafka doesn’t delete it immediately.
  The consumer just **commits the offset** so it knows next time where to resume.

---

## ✅ Summary

* **Kafka Offset** = unique ID of a message in a partition.
* Works like a **bookmark** for consumers.
* Helps ensure **no data loss, no duplication**, and ordered consumption.

---

## 📌 Current Offset vs Committed Offset

### 1️⃣ **Current Offset**

* The **position of the message the consumer is *currently reading*** in a partition.
* Moves forward as the consumer fetches new messages.
* Not stored permanently (just in memory while processing).

👉 Think of it as **“where I am now”**.

---

### 2️⃣ **Committed Offset**

* The **last successfully processed offset** that the consumer has explicitly saved (committed) to Kafka (or an external store).
* Ensures that if the consumer restarts/crashes, it can **resume from this committed offset**.

👉 Think of it as **“where I will resume from next time”**.

---

## 🛠️ Example

Let’s say Kafka Partition 0 has messages:

| Offset | Message     |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 0      | OrderID=101 |
| 1      | OrderID=102 |
| 2      | OrderID=103 |
| 3      | OrderID=104 |

* Consumer A starts reading.
* **Current Offset = 2** → It is processing `OrderID=103`.
* After successful processing, it **commits offset 3**.

So now:

* **Current Offset = 2** (still reading `OrderID=103`)
* **Committed Offset = 3** (means it finished processing `OrderID=102`, and next restart will resume from `103`)

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters?

* If you **don’t commit offsets**, on restart → consumer might re-read old messages (duplicates).
* If you **commit too early**, you risk losing unprocessed data if a crash happens.
* If you **commit after processing**, you ensure reliability (at least once processing).

---

✅ **Summary**

* **Current Offset** = where consumer is right now.
* **Committed Offset** = where consumer will resume from if restarted.
* Together, they guarantee **reliable message consumption** in Kafka.

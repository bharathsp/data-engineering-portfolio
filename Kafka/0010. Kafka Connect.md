## 📌 What is **Kafka Connect**?

👉 **Kafka Connect** is a **framework/tool** provided by Apache Kafka to **move large amounts of data in and out of Kafka** without writing custom code.

Think of it as a **plug-and-play data pipeline** 🔌 for Kafka.

* It provides **pre-built connectors** for databases, file systems, cloud services, etc.
* Handles **scalability, fault tolerance, and parallelism** automatically.
* Saves you from writing custom producers/consumers for every integration.

## 🎯 Why Use Kafka Connect?

* ✅ **Ingest data** from external systems (databases, APIs, files) → Kafka topics.
* ✅ **Export data** from Kafka → external systems (data warehouses, search indexes, NoSQL).
* ✅ **No coding needed** → just configure JSON connector files.
* ✅ **Scales easily** (standalone for small jobs, distributed mode for production).

## 🛠️ Example Use Cases

1. **Database → Kafka**
   Use a JDBC source connector to continuously stream new rows from MySQL into a Kafka topic.

2. **Kafka → Data Warehouse**
   Use a Snowflake sink connector to push processed Kafka data into Snowflake for analytics.

3. **Kafka → Elasticsearch**
   Use a sink connector to index Kafka data into Elasticsearch for fast searching.

## ✅ Summary

* **Kafka Connect** = Data integration framework for Kafka.
* Acts like a **bridge** 🌉 between Kafka and external systems.
* Provides **Source Connectors** (import into Kafka) and **Sink Connectors** (export from Kafka).
* Used for **ETL, real-time streaming, and data integration**.

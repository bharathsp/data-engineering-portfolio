**Grafana** is an **open-source platform for monitoring and observability**. It allows you to **visualize, analyze, and alert on metrics and logs** from a wide variety of data sources in real time.

Think of Grafana as a **dashboard engine**: it takes raw data from systems, databases, or applications and turns it into interactive graphs, charts, and alerts.

## ðŸ”¹ Why Grafana is Used

1. **Visualization**

   * Transform raw data into dashboards with line charts, heatmaps, tables, gauges, and more.
   * Example: Visualizing CPU, memory, and disk usage across servers.

2. **Monitoring**

   * Monitor performance metrics of applications, servers, databases, or cloud services.
   * Example: Track HTTP request latency of a web application.

3. **Alerting**

   * Set thresholds to trigger alerts via email, Slack, or PagerDuty if a metric goes beyond normal limits.
   * Example: Alert DevOps if CPU usage exceeds 90% for more than 5 minutes.

4. **Multiple Data Sources**

   * Connect to **Prometheus, InfluxDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Loki**, cloud monitoring services, and more.
   * This makes it flexible for both on-premises and cloud monitoring.

5. **Customizable Dashboards**

   * Users can create interactive dashboards for teams, combine multiple metrics, and drill down into specific data points.

6. **Open Source & Extensible**

   * Free to use and extendable with plugins for additional visualization types or data sources.

## ðŸ”¹ Typical Use Cases

| Use Case                        | Example                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Server & Application Monitoring | Track CPU, memory, network usage of servers and containers.              |
| Database Monitoring             | Visualize query performance, connections, or replication lag.            |
| DevOps / Cloud Monitoring       | Observe Kubernetes cluster health or cloud services metrics.             |
| Business Metrics                | Monitor user activity, sales KPIs, or API usage.                         |
| Logs & Traces                   | Combine Grafana with **Loki** or **Tempo** to visualize logs and traces. |

## ðŸ”¹ Architecture Overview

1. **Data Sources** â†’ Collect metrics/logs from systems, databases, or cloud services.
2. **Grafana Server** â†’ Queries data sources, processes data, and serves dashboards.
3. **Dashboards & Panels** â†’ Visualization layer for users to interact with data.
4. **Alerting System** â†’ Sends notifications when thresholds are crossed.

ðŸ’¡ **Analogy:**

* If **Prometheus** is the thermometer measuring your servers, **Grafana** is the dashboard that shows a **colorful, real-time chart of all the readings** and lets you know if something is overheating.

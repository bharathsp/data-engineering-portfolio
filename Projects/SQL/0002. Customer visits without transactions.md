## 🛒 Problem: Customers Who Visited Without Transactions

### 📋 Tables:

#### 🧾 `Visits`

| 🔑 Column Name | 🧮 Type |
|----------------|--------|
| `visit_id`     | int    |
| `customer_id`  | int    |

- `visit_id` is the **primary key**.
- This table contains information about the customers who **visited the mall**.

#### 💳 `Transactions`

| 🔑 Column Name    | 🧮 Type |
|-------------------|--------|
| `transaction_id`  | int    |
| `visit_id`        | int    |
| `amount`          | int    |

- `transaction_id` is the **primary key**.
- This table contains information about **transactions** made during each `visit_id`.

---

### 🎯 Task:

Write a SQL query to **find the customer IDs** who **visited the mall but did not make any transactions**, and the **number of such visits**.

> 🧾 Return the result sorted in **any order**.

### 📊 Example:

#### 📥 Input:

`Visits` table:

| 🆔 visit_id | 👤 customer_id |
|-------------|----------------|
| 1           | 23             |
| 2           | 9              |
| 4           | 30             |
| 5           | 54             |
| 6           | 96             |
| 7           | 54             |
| 8           | 54             |

`Transactions` table:

| 🆔 transaction_id | 🆔 visit_id | 💰 amount |
|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| 2                 | 5           | 310        |
| 3                 | 5           | 300        |
| 9                 | 5           | 200        |
| 12                | 1           | 910        |
| 13                | 2           | 970        |

---

#### 📤 Output:

| 👤 customer_id | 🚫 count_no_trans |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 54             | 2                 |
| 30             | 1                 |
| 96             | 1                 |

---

### 🧠 Explanation:

- ✅ Customer **23** visited once and **made a transaction** → ❌ not included.
- ✅ Customer **9** visited once and **made a transaction** → ❌ not included.
- ❌ Customer **30** visited once and **made no transaction** → ✅ included.
- 🔄 Customer **54** visited **3 times**: **2 times with no transactions** → ✅ included with `count = 2`.
- ❌ Customer **96** visited once and **made no transaction** → ✅ included.

### 💻 Solution SQL Query
```sql
SELECT v.customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY v.customer_id;
```

---

### ✅ **Explanation**:

1. **`LEFT JOIN`**:
   - Combines each row from `Visits` with matching rows in `Transactions` based on `visit_id`.
   - If no transaction exists for a visit, the `transaction_id` will be `NULL`.

2. **`WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL`**:
   - Filters out the visits that **did not have a corresponding transaction** (i.e., no spending occurred).

3. **`GROUP BY v.customer_id`**:
   - Groups the filtered results by customer to count how many times **each customer visited without transacting**.

4. **`COUNT(*)`**:
   - Counts how many such no-transaction visits occurred for each customer.

### 🧾 Sample Output Based on Your Input:

| customer_id | count_no_trans |
|-------------|----------------|
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |

Let me know if you'd like the same logic as a **Python/Pandas solution**, or in another SQL dialect like PostgreSQL or BigQuery.

To **delete duplicate rows while keeping only the latest record**, you need a way to:

1. Identify duplicates (based on key columns).
2. Keep the **latest** record (based on a `timestamp`, `id`, or `created_at` column).
3. Delete all others.

### âœ… Example Table: `Users`

| id | name  | email                                   | created\_at         |
| -- | ----- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1  | Alice | [alice@mail.com](mailto:alice@mail.com) | 2024-01-01 10:00:00 |
| 2  | Alice | [alice@mail.com](mailto:alice@mail.com) | 2024-03-01 09:00:00 |
| 3  | Bob   | [bob@mail.com](mailto:bob@mail.com)     | 2024-02-15 14:00:00 |

Letâ€™s say `name` and `email` define a duplicate. We want to keep the latest `created_at` per (name, email).

### ðŸ”¸ **Option 1: Use `CTE` + `ROW_NUMBER()` (Most Reliable â€“ PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.)**

```sql
WITH RankedUsers AS (
  SELECT *,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY name, email ORDER BY created_at DESC) AS rn
  FROM Users
)
DELETE FROM Users
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM RankedUsers WHERE rn > 1
);
```

âœ… Keeps **only the latest `created_at` row** per duplicate group.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Option 2: Use `NOT IN` (if window functions not supported)**

```sql
DELETE FROM Users
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT MAX(id)
  FROM Users
  GROUP BY name, email
);
```

* Assumes higher `id` = latest
* Use with caution if `id` doesn't match the latest timestamp

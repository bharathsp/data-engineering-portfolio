## 📬 Table: `Confirmations`

| Column Name | Type     | Description                                               |

| `time_stamp`| `datetime` | Timestamp of the confirmation attempt                 |
| `action`    | `ENUM`   | 'confirmed' ✅ or 'timeout' ⏰                             |

- 🧩 (`user_id`, `time_stamp`) is the **primary key**.
- 🔗 `user_id` is a **foreign key** referencing `Signups(user_id)`.

## 🎯 Goal

Calculate the **confirmation rate** for each user:
- Confirmation Rate = Confirmed Messages \ Total Requests

- If a user has **no confirmation requests**, the rate is `0.00`.
- 🎯 Round the result to **2 decimal places**.
- 📋 Return a result with **each user** and their **confirmation rate**.

- User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
- User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
- User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.

### **What is the similar type of join in Hadoop to Spark's Broadcast Join?**

> **✅ Answer: Map-Side Join**

### 🔁 **Comparison: Spark Broadcast Join vs. Hadoop Map-Side Join**

| Feature           | **Spark (Broadcast Join)**                         | **Hadoop (Map-Side Join)**                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Purpose           | Optimize joins when one table is small             | Same — perform join without shuffling            |
| How it works      | Broadcast small dataset to all executors           | Distribute small dataset to all mappers          |
| Shuffle required? | ❌ No                                               | ❌ No                                             |
| Suitable for      | Small dimension tables + large fact tables         | Small file joined with large file in each mapper |
| Example join type | Fact table join with dimension table (star schema) | Lookup table join in MapReduce                   |

### 📌 **Why it’s called Map-Side Join in Hadoop?**

Because the **join happens entirely in the Map phase**, **before the Reduce stage**, by **loading the smaller dataset into memory** and streaming through the larger one.

Similarly, in **Spark**, `broadcast()` allows you to **avoid shuffling the large table**, just like Hadoop avoids a shuffle by joining during the map phase.

### 🧠 Key Benefits of Both:

* Eliminates costly **shuffle**.
* Great for **skewed data**.
* Much **faster** for specific workloads like **lookup joins** or **star-schema joins**.

### ✅ Conclusion:

> **Broadcast Join in Spark** is conceptually equivalent to the **Map-Side Join in Hadoop MapReduce** — both aim to **reduce shuffle and improve performance** by **pushing a small dataset to all tasks**.

## 🔄 **1. CDC – Change Data Capture**

### 📘 Definition:

**CDC** is a **data integration technique** used to **detect and capture changes** (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) in a **source system** (usually a database) and replicate them to a target system (like a data warehouse or data lake).

### 🔍 Goal:

**Capture real-time changes** in operational systems and **keep downstream systems in sync**.

### 💡 Example Use Case:

* Replicating changes from MySQL to BigQuery in near real-time.
* Streaming customer transaction updates into a data lake.

### ✅ Key Characteristics:

| Feature         | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Operation-based | Tracks INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE                  |
| Real-time       | Often used in streaming pipelines              |
| Tool examples   | Debezium, Fivetran, AWS DMS, Oracle GoldenGate |
| Used in         | ETL/ELT, replication, lakehouse ingestion      |

## 🧠 **2. SCD – Slowly Changing Dimension**

### 📘 Definition:

**SCD** refers to a **data warehouse design pattern** used to **manage changes to dimensional data** over time (e.g., customer address, product category).

### 🔍 Goal:

**Track historical changes** in dimension tables while preserving older values for analysis.

### 🏷️ SCD Types:

| Type       | Description                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| SCD Type 1 | Overwrite old value (no history)                          |
| SCD Type 2 | Keep old value as a new row with versioning/timestamps    |
| SCD Type 3 | Keep old and new values in the same row (limited history) |

### 💡 Example Use Case:

* Tracking customer's address changes over time for sales region analysis.

### ✅ Key Characteristics:

| Feature                | Description                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Data warehouse focused | Applies to **dimension** tables              |
| Historical tracking    | Captures **how values change**               |
| Query impact           | Supports **as-of** or **historical reports** |

## 🆚 CDC vs SCD – Summary Comparison

| Feature        | **CDC** (Change Data Capture)                  | **SCD** (Slowly Changing Dimension)         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| What it tracks | **Row-level changes** (insert/update/delete)   | **Dimensional attribute changes** over time |
| Use case       | Data ingestion, replication, real-time updates | Historical tracking in dimension tables     |
| Scope          | All kinds of tables (OLTP, operational)        | Mostly dimension tables (OLAP)              |
| Real-time?     | ✅ Often real-time                              | ❌ Usually batch/ETL                         |
| Example Tool   | Debezium, AWS DMS, Kafka Connect               | Spark ETL, Informatica, dbt, etc.           |

## 🎯 Quick Analogy:

* **CDC** = "What changed just now?"
* **SCD** = "What did it used to be, and when?"

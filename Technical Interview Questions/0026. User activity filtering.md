### ✅ Rephrased Question:

You are given a PySpark DataFrame `df_clean` with user activity data, where each row contains a `user_id` and an `activity_type`.
The `activity_type` column can have values like:

* `"addcart"` — user added items to cart
* `"pagepayment"` — user visited the payment page
* `"shpmntconfirmation"` — user received a shipment confirmation

---

### **Tasks:**

1. Identify users who **added items to cart but never reached the payment page** (`NoPayment` users).
2. Identify users who **completed payment but never received a shipment confirmation** (`NoShipment` users).

---

### ✅ PySpark Code Solution:

```python
# Step 1: Get user IDs for each activity type
addcart_users = df_clean.filter(df_clean.activity_type == "addcart") \
                        .select("user_id").distinct()
payment_users = df_clean.filter(df_clean.activity_type == "pagepayment") \
                        .select("user_id").distinct()
shipment_users = df_clean.filter(df_clean.activity_type == "shpmntconfirmation") \
                         .select("user_id").distinct()

# Convert to sets for set operations
addcart_user_ids = set(addcart_users.rdd.flatMap(lambda x: x).collect())
payment_user_ids = set(payment_users.rdd.flatMap(lambda x: x).collect())
shipment_user_ids = set(shipment_users.rdd.flatMap(lambda x: x).collect())

# Step 2: Identify users who added to cart but never paid
NoPayment = addcart_user_ids - payment_user_ids
print("NoPayment users:", NoPayment)

# Step 3: Identify users who paid but never got shipment confirmation
NoShipment = payment_user_ids - shipment_user_ids
print("NoShipment users:", NoShipment)
```

### 📝 Notes:

* `.distinct()` ensures duplicate user actions don’t affect results.
* Set operations (`-`) help efficiently identify missing transitions between funnel stages.

## **1. What is the CAP Theorem?**

The **CAP theorem** (by Eric Brewer) states that in a distributed system, you can **only guarantee two** out of these three properties at the same time:

1. **C – Consistency** 📏
   Every read receives the most recent write (data is the same across all nodes instantly).

2. **A – Availability** ⚡
   Every request receives a (non-error) response, without guaranteeing it is the most recent.

3. **P – Partition Tolerance** 🌐
   The system continues to operate despite network partitions or communication breakdown between nodes.

## **2. The Triangle View**

Here’s the visual way to remember it:

```
    📏
Consistency (C)
    / \
   /   \
⚡-------🌐
Availability   Partition Tolerance
```

* **You can pick only two at a time:**

  * **CA (No Partition Tolerance)** – Works when network is reliable (rare in real distributed systems).
    Example: Traditional relational databases on a single server.

  * **CP (No Availability)** – System prefers correctness over speed; it may reject requests during partition.
    Example: MongoDB (in certain configurations), HBase.

  * **AP (No Consistency)** – System stays up and responds, but may return stale data.
    Example: Cassandra, DynamoDB.

## **3. Icons & Real-Life Analogy**

**Icons representation:**

* 📏 **Consistency** – Like everyone reading from the *same* whiteboard at the same time.
* ⚡ **Availability** – Like a shop that *always* answers the phone, even if the stock info might be outdated.
* 🌐 **Partition Tolerance** – Like continuing to operate even when the phone line between two shops is cut.

## **4. Why It Matters**

* **Distributed systems must tolerate partitions** 🌐 in reality, so the real choice is usually **CP vs AP**.
* The decision depends on whether you value *fresh data* (CP) or *always answering* (AP).

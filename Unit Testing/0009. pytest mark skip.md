## ⏩ **What is `@pytest.mark.skip`?**

It’s a **pytest decorator** that tells pytest:

> “Don’t run this test at all — skip it every time.”

You usually use it when the test is **not ready**, **not relevant**, or depends on something that’s currently unavailable.

---

## 🎯 **Why use it?**

* 🚧 The feature isn’t implemented yet.
* 🐞 Waiting for a bug to be fixed before testing.
* 🌐 External dependency (like an API) is down.
* 🛠 Temporarily disable a test without deleting it.

---

## ⚙ **How it works**

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.skip(reason="Feature not ready yet")
def test_new_feature():
    assert False
```

**What happens:**

* `reason` explains **why** it’s skipped (shows up in test report).
* Pytest will **not run** the test — it’s marked as **skipped** in the output.

## 📊 **Example Output**

```
collected 1 item

================== 1 skipped in 0.02s ==================
```

(`s` means skipped)

## 📍 **Real-Life Analogy**

It’s like **putting a chair in front of a “Wet Paint” wall** 🎨 — you’re not touching it right now, but you’ll check it later when it’s ready.

## 🧪 **What is Unit Testing?**

Unit testing is like **checking each Lego block** 🧱 before building the whole castle.
You test **small, individual parts** of your code (functions, methods, classes) to make sure they work correctly — **before combining them into the big program**.

## 🎯 **Why is it Used?**

* ✅ **Catch bugs early** 🐞 — before they spread.
* ✅ **Save time & money** 💰 — fixing small issues is cheaper.
* ✅ **Boost confidence** 💪 — you know your code works.
* ✅ **Prevent future breakage** 🔧 — tests alert you if changes break something.

## ⏳ **When is it Used?**

* 🏗 **During development** — right after you write a function.
* 🔄 **During code changes** — to ensure new code doesn’t break old features.
* 📦 **Before releases** — for a final quality check.

💡 **Quick Analogy:**
Unit testing is like a **chef tasting each dish** 🍲 before serving the full meal — making sure **each item is perfect** before it reaches the customer.

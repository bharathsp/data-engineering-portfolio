## ✅ **What is `assert` in pytest?**

In pytest, **`assert`** is the **truth checker** 🕵️ of your test.

It **compares the actual result** of your code with the **expected result**, and:

* ✅ **Passes** if they match.
* ❌ **Fails** if they don’t — and pytest shows you exactly what went wrong.

---

## 🎯 **Why use `assert`?**

Because without it, pytest wouldn’t know if your code is **correct**.
It’s like saying:

> “Hey pytest, make sure this thing is true — or throw an error.”

---

## 🛠 **How it works**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5  # ✅ Pass
    assert add(2, 3) == 6  # ❌ Fail
```

* First assert → **True**, test passes.
* Second assert → **False**, pytest shows:

```
E       assert 5 == 6
```

---

## 📍 **Real-Life Analogy**

`assert` in pytest is like a **quality inspector** 🏭:

* If the product matches the standard ✅ — pass.
* If it doesn’t ❌ — reject it immediately.

---

## ✨ Extra Tip

In pytest, unlike some testing frameworks, you **don’t need special assert methods** like `self.assertEqual()`.
Just use Python’s built-in `assert` — pytest makes the failure messages **clear and readable**.

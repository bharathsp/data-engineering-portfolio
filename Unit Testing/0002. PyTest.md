## 🐍 **What is pytest?**

**pytest** is a **Python testing framework** that makes writing and running tests **easy, powerful, and fun**.
Think of it like a **detective** 🕵️ who checks your code for problems — and reports exactly where things go wrong.

## 🎯 **Why Use pytest?**

* ✅ **Simple syntax** — write fewer lines of code. ✍️
* ✅ **Readable results** — see instantly which tests passed/failed. 📊
* ✅ **Scalable** — works for tiny scripts or huge projects. 📦
* ✅ **Supports fixtures & plugins** — customize your testing flow. 🔌

---

## ⏳ **When to Use pytest?**

* 🏗 **While building code** — test small functions right after writing them.
* 🔄 **After bug fixes** — make sure the fix works (and doesn’t break something else).
* 📦 **Before deployment** — ensure the app is stable.

## 🛠 **How to Use pytest in Real Life**

Imagine you’re building a **shopping cart system** 🛒.
You write a `calculate_total()` function.
With pytest, you:

1. **Write a test** to check if `calculate_total()` gives correct results.
2. Run `pytest`.
3. ✅ If it passes — you’re good. ❌ If it fails — you fix the bug before customers notice.

---

## ⚙ **How to Set It Up**

1. **Install pytest**

```bash
pip install pytest
```

2. **Create a test file** (must start with `test_` or end with `_test.py`)

```python
# test_math.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
```

3. **Run pytest**

```bash
pytest
```

4. **See results** ✅ or ❌ in your terminal.

## 📍 **Real-Life Example**

**Scenario:** You built a food delivery app 🍔.

* You test `calculate_delivery_time()` with pytest.
* If a bug pops up (e.g., wrong time calculation), pytest catches it instantly before the customer gets an **"arrives in -5 mins"** notification. 🚀

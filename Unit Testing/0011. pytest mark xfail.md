## ❌➡️✅ **What is `@pytest.mark.xfail`?**

`xfail` stands for **expected fail**.
It tells pytest:

> “I know this test will fail — and that’s okay.”

Instead of marking it as a failure in the report, pytest shows it as **expected failure** ✅❌.

---

## 🎯 **Why use it?**

* 🐞 There’s a known bug you haven’t fixed yet.
* 🚧 The feature isn’t fully implemented.
* 🧪 You’re testing something experimental.
* 📌 You want to **remind yourself** this is still broken — but not fail the whole test suite.

---

## ⚙ **Example**

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.xfail(reason="Bug #42 not fixed yet")
def test_known_bug():
    assert 1 + 1 == 3
```

**What happens:**

* The test **fails** (because 1+1 ≠ 3) but pytest marks it as **XFAIL** instead of a red fail.

---

## 🛠 **Example with Pass (XPASS)**

If an `xfail` test unexpectedly passes, pytest shows **XPASS**.

```python
@pytest.mark.xfail(reason="Waiting for bug fix")
def test_bug_fixed():
    assert 2 + 2 == 4
```

**What happens:**

* Test passes → pytest says **XPASS** (“Expected fail, but passed”).

---

## 📊 **Sample Output**

```
collected 2 items
test_example.py xX
================== 1 xfailed, 1 xpassed ==================
```

* `x` = expected fail
* `X` = unexpected pass

## 📍 **Real-Life Analogy**

It’s like **submitting a broken homework assignment** 📄 knowing it won’t get full marks — but you still turn it in so your teacher knows you’re working on it.

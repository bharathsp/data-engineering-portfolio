To process 25GB of data in spark

* a. How many CPU cores are required?
* b. How many executors are required?
* c. How much memory is required for each executor?
* d. What is the total memory required?

## **Step 1 â€“ Understanding Spark resource calculation**

When deciding Spark resources, you need:

* **Data size** (25 GB given)
* **Executor memory allocation rule** (leave \~1 GB overhead for Spark/YARN)
* **Number of cores per executor** (usually 4â€“5 for optimal parallelism)
* **Data-to-memory ratio** (rule of thumb: `2x data size` in memory for shuffle/processing overhead)

---

### **A. Number of CPU Cores**

**Rule:**

* Spark parallelism works best with **\~4 cores per executor**.
* **Number of cores total** â‰ˆ `(Data size / Data per core)` Ã— cores per executor.

We need to know **how much data one core should handle**.
A common guideline is:

> 1 core can comfortably handle **2â€“3 GB** of in-memory data without becoming a bottleneck.

Letâ€™s assume **2.5 GB per core**:

```
Total cores needed = 25 GB Ã· 2.5 GB = 10 cores
```

âœ… **Answer:** **10 CPU cores** (can be split across executors)

---

### **B. Number of Executors**

We donâ€™t want 1 giant executor (bad for fault tolerance), so:

* If each executor has **4 cores**:

```
Executors = Total cores Ã· Cores per executor
Executors = 10 Ã· 4 = 2.5 â‰ˆ 3 executors
```

Weâ€™ll slightly over-provision, so **3 executors** is fine.

---

### **C. Memory Required per Executor**

**Rule:**

* Memory per executor = `(Data per executor Ã— Overhead factor)`
* Overhead factor: \~1.2 to 2 (due to shuffle, caching, etc.)
* Also, leave **\~1 GB** for YARN/Mesos overhead.

First, **data per executor**:

```
Data per executor = Total data Ã· Number of executors
= 25 GB Ã· 3 â‰ˆ 8.33 GB
```

Add **2Ã— overhead** for Spark shuffles:

```
8.33 GB Ã— 2 = 16.66 GB
```

Add **1 GB YARN overhead**:

```
16.66 + 1 â‰ˆ 17.66 GB
```

Weâ€™ll round up to the nearest GB (and often allocate in even GBs):
âœ… **Answer:** **18 GB per executor**

---

### **D. Total Memory Required**

```
Total memory = Memory per executor Ã— Number of executors
= 18 GB Ã— 3 = 54 GB
```

âœ… **Answer:** **54 GB total cluster memory**

## **Final Spark Resource Plan**

| Parameter                  | Value     | Reason                          |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| **a. CPU cores**           | **10**    | Based on \~2.5 GB/core          |
| **b. Executors**           | **3**     | 4 cores/executor rule           |
| **c. Memory per executor** | **18 GB** | 2Ã— shuffle overhead + 1 GB YARN |
| **d. Total memory**        | **54 GB** | 18 GB Ã— 3 executors             |

## **Extra Tip** ðŸš€

In Spark, this would translate to:

```bash
--num-executors 3 \
--executor-cores 4 \
--executor-memory 18G
```

(Since 3 Ã— 4 cores = 12 cores, a bit more than our minimum 10 cores, giving better parallelism.)

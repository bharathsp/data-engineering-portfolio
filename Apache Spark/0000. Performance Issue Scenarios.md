# You are having a spark job which has been running fine until now but today you see the job is taking too long to complete. How would you debug this particular issue? How would you come up with a solution for it?

## 🕵️ **Step 1: Detect the Problem**

**Symptom:**
Your Spark job was running fine before, but today it’s **slow as molasses**.

**First questions to ask:**

* Has **data volume** increased? 📈
* Has the **code** or **query logic** changed? ✏️
* Has the **cluster configuration** changed? ⚙️
* Is there **resource contention** with other jobs? 🤼

---

## 🔍 **Step 2: Check the Spark UI (Web UI)**

The Spark Web UI is your **X-ray machine** for Spark jobs.

**Icons & Key Tabs:**

* **📊 Stage view** → See how long each stage takes.
* **📦 Storage** → Check memory usage & cached RDDs.
* **⚡ Executors** → Look for failed executors, high GC time, or idle time.
* **🛠 Jobs** → Identify the slowest stage/task.

💡 *If one stage is abnormally slow, that’s your hotspot.*

## 🧠 **Step 3: Look for the Usual Suspects**

| Problem 🛑                      | Symptoms                                | How to Check 🔍                    | Possible Fix 💡                                    |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Skew 🍉**                | Some tasks take much longer than others | Stage → Task Duration chart        | Repartition, Salting keys                          |
| **GC Pressure 🗑**              | High GC time in Executors tab           | Executors → GC Time %              | Increase executor memory, optimize object creation |
| **Shuffles 💨**                 | Slow network transfer                   | Stage details → Shuffle Read/Write | Reduce shuffles, use `mapPartitions`               |
| **Too many small files 📄📄📄** | Long file listing and read time         | Input source analysis              | Merge files, use compaction                        |
| **Resource Contention ⚔️**      | Multiple jobs slowing each other        | Cluster monitoring                 | Schedule jobs during low load                      |

## 🛠 **Step 4: Debugging Workflow**

1️⃣ **🗺 Map the Job** — Identify stages from Spark UI
2️⃣ **⏱ Check Stage Time** — See which stage is a bottleneck
3️⃣ **📏 Look at Task Duration Distribution** — Are some tasks way longer?
4️⃣ **📦 Check Shuffle & Spill** — Is there disk spill from insufficient memory?
5️⃣ **🗄 Look at Input Data Size** — Has the data size spiked?

---

## 🚀 **Step 5: Solutions**

* **⚖ Balance the Data**: If skewed, use salting or repartitioning.
* **🧹 Clean Up Data**: Remove small files, pre-aggregate.
* **📦 Optimize Storage**: Cache only necessary data; unpersist when done.
* **⚡ Increase Parallelism**: Tune `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` and executor cores.
* **🧠 Smarter Joins**: Use broadcast joins for small datasets.

---

## 🎯 Example Fix Path

* Spark UI shows Stage 4 taking 80% of total time.
* Task Duration chart shows 2 tasks running **way longer** (data skew).
* You **salt the join key** → repartition → rerun → job completes in normal time.

📌 **Final Thought:**
Debugging Spark jobs is **part detective work 🕵️**, **part surgeon 🩺**, and **part mechanic 🔧**. The Spark UI is your **main instrument panel**, and once you know where the bottleneck is, you can choose the right tuning strategy.

**Apache Spark** is an **open-source**, distributed computing system designed for **fast, large-scale data processing**. It provides an **in-memory computing framework** that is much faster than traditional big data tools like Hadoop MapReduce.

* Developed at UC Berkeley's AMPLab
* Now maintained by the **Apache Software Foundation**

### ⚙️ Why is Apache Spark Used?

Apache Spark is used for:

| **Use Case**                    | **Description**                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Batch Processing**            | Process large volumes of historical data (e.g., data from logs or files) |
| **Real-Time Stream Processing** | Handle continuous data streams (e.g., Twitter feeds, IoT sensors)        |
| **Machine Learning**            | Build ML models using **Spark MLlib**                                    |
| **ETL Pipelines**               | Extract, Transform, Load tasks across distributed systems                |
| **Graph Processing**            | Use **GraphX** for social networks, recommendation systems, etc.         |
| **SQL Queries on Big Data**     | Query large-scale structured data using **Spark SQL**                    |

# 🧠 **What is Spark Memory Manager?**

* Spark’s **Memory Manager** controls how memory (RAM) is allocated between different Spark components (execution, storage, caching, etc.).
* Since Spark runs on JVM, it has to carefully manage memory for:

  * **Execution** → shuffles, joins, aggregations, sorting.
  * **Storage** → caching/persisting RDDs/DataFrames.
  * **User data & metadata** → broadcast variables, internal structures.

👉 Good memory management = fewer spills to disk = faster Spark jobs.

# ⚡ **Spark Memory Management Models**

Spark had **two generations of memory managers**:

### 1. **Static Memory Manager (pre-Spark 1.6)**

* Fixed division of memory:

  * 60% for execution
  * 40% for storage
* No sharing → wasted memory if one side was underutilized.

### 2. **Unified Memory Manager (Spark 1.6+)** ✅ (default now)

* Execution and storage share memory **dynamically**.
* If execution needs more space, it can borrow from storage (and evict cached data).
* If storage needs more, it can borrow from execution (if idle).

👉 This flexibility improves utilization and avoids wasted memory.

# 🏗️ **How Spark Memory is Divided**

Total memory available to Spark = **Executor memory** (`spark.executor.memory`)

### Breakdown:

1. **Reserved Memory (\~300MB)** → for Spark’s internal use.
2. **User Memory (\~25%)** → for user code (e.g., Python objects in UDFs).
3. **Spark Memory (\~75%)** → managed by Spark’s Memory Manager:

   * **Execution Memory** → shuffles, joins, aggregations, sorts.
   * **Storage Memory** → cached RDDs/DataFrames, broadcast variables.

📊 Example:
If executor = 8 GB →

* Reserved: 300 MB
* User memory: \~2 GB
* Spark memory: \~6 GB (shared between execution & storage)

# 🔄 **Execution vs Storage Memory**

* **Execution Memory**

  * Used during query processing.
  * Temporary buffers for shuffles, aggregations, joins.
  * Freed after task completes.

* **Storage Memory**

  * Used for caching/persisting RDDs & DataFrames.
  * Keeps data in memory for reuse.
  * Can be evicted if execution needs space.

👉 With **Unified Memory Manager**, these areas can borrow from each other dynamically.

# 🖼️ **Analogy**

Imagine Spark memory as a **kitchen 🍳**:

* **Execution Memory = Counter space** → temporary area to chop veggies, mix ingredients.
* **Storage Memory = Refrigerator** → keeps prepared food (cached data) for later use.
* If the counter is full, you may take stuff out of the fridge temporarily (eviction).
* If the fridge is half empty, you can use it to store extra bowls temporarily.

# ⚡ **Best Practices for Spark Memory Management**

1. **Cache wisely** → only cache DataFrames reused multiple times.
2. **Avoid over-caching** → don’t fill storage with large datasets unnecessarily.
3. **Tune executor memory** (`spark.executor.memory`, `spark.executor.cores`) based on workload.
4. **Increase parallelism** (`spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`) to reduce shuffle spill.
5. **Monitor memory** → Spark UI → “Storage” and “Executors” tabs show memory usage.

# ✅ **Summary**

* Spark Memory Manager = decides how to allocate RAM between execution & storage.
* Old system = Static (fixed split), New system = Unified (dynamic sharing).
* Memory areas:

  * Reserved (\~300MB)
  * User (\~25%)
  * Execution + Storage (\~75%, shared)
* Goal: **maximize performance & reduce disk spills**.

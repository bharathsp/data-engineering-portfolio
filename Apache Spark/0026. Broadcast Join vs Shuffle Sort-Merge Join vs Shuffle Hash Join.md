## 🔹 1. Broadcast Join

### 📌 What it is:

Spark **broadcasts** the smaller dataset to **all executors**, avoiding shuffle operations.

### ✅ When to use:

* One table is **small enough** to fit in memory (typically < 10 MB – configurable).
* Joins like `large_table JOIN small_table`.

### 🧠 Example:

```python
df_large.join(broadcast(df_small), on="id")
```

### 🚀 Pros:

* Extremely fast (no shuffle)
* Avoids sorting and partitioning

### ⚠️ Cons:

* Not suitable if the small table is too big to broadcast (OOM risk)

## 🔹 2. Shuffle Sort-Merge Join (SMJ)

### 📌 What it is:

Both sides of the join are **shuffled**, **sorted** by join key, and then **merged**.

### ✅ When to use:

* Both datasets are **large**
* Join keys are **sorted or sortable**
* Joins on **equi-keys**

### 🧠 Spark will automatically use SMJ when:

* No broadcast possible
* Tables are large and **have sorting capability**

### 🚀 Pros:

* Scalable for large tables
* Works well with partitioned/sorted data

### ⚠️ Cons:

* Expensive: involves **shuffle + sort**
* Slower than broadcast joins

## 🔹 3. Shuffle Hash Join (SHJ)

### 📌 What it is:

* Spark **shuffles** both datasets and builds a **hash table** for one side (typically the smaller one).
* Then joins using hash lookup.

### ✅ When to use:

* Join key is not sortable
* At least one side **fits in memory** (but not small enough to broadcast)

### 🚀 Pros:

* Faster than sort-merge for small-medium size joins
* Efficient when keys are **not ordered**

### ⚠️ Cons:

* Requires memory to build hash table
* May fall back to **Sort-Merge Join** if hash table can't fit in memory

## 🔸 Summary Table

| Join Type              | Use Case                                | Shuffle | Memory Needed     | Performance |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| **Broadcast Join**     | One side is very small                  | ❌       | Low (small table) | ⚡ Fastest   |
| **Shuffle Sort-Merge** | Large datasets with sortable join keys  | ✅       | Medium            | ⚠️ Slower   |
| **Shuffle Hash Join**  | Medium-size datasets, non-sortable keys | ✅       | Medium-high       | ✅ Efficient |

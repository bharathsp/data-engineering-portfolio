The **Spark UI** is a **web-based interface** that lets you monitor and debug your Spark applications in real time or after they finish running.

Think of it like Spark’s **“mission control dashboard”** — it shows you what’s happening inside your job:

* Which stages and tasks are running
* How much time each took
* Memory, CPU, and shuffle data usage
* Any errors or slowdowns

---

## **1️⃣ Where to Access It**

* **Local mode:** By default at `http://localhost:4040` while your app runs.
* **Cluster mode:** Accessed through the Spark master’s URL or your cluster manager (YARN, Kubernetes, Databricks, etc.).
* After the job ends, it’s available in **Spark History Server** (if enabled).

---

## **2️⃣ Key Tabs in Spark UI**

| **Tab**         | **What It Shows**                                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Jobs**        | High-level list of Spark jobs with status, duration, and links to stages.          |
| **Stages**      | Breakdown of each job into stages; shows task counts, shuffle read/write, GC time. |
| **Tasks**       | Details per task (executor ID, duration, input size, errors).                      |
| **Storage**     | RDD/DataFrame caching info (size, partitions).                                     |
| **Environment** | Spark configuration, JVM settings, classpath info.                                 |
| **Executors**   | Memory and CPU usage per executor; task success/failure rates.                     |
| **SQL**         | (For Spark SQL) Logical and physical query plans, execution time, metrics.         |

---

## **3️⃣ Why It’s Useful**

* **Debugging**: Find slow stages, skewed data, or failed tasks.
* **Performance tuning**: See if jobs are waiting on shuffle, spilling to disk, or running out of memory.
* **Memory monitoring**: Track GC time, storage usage, executor memory pressure.
* **Execution tracing**: View DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) visualization of transformations.

---

## **4️⃣ Example Workflow**

Let’s say your Spark job is slow:

1. Open Spark UI → **Jobs tab** → Identify the slow job.
2. Click into **Stages** → See if one stage is much slower.
3. Check **Tasks** → Maybe one task took 2 minutes while others took 5 seconds (data skew!).
4. Look at **Executors** → Some executors might be idle while others are overloaded.
5. Tune partitioning, memory, or parallelism accordingly.

---

💡 In short — **Spark UI is your real-time X-ray machine for Spark jobs**. Without it, tuning performance or finding bottlenecks is like driving at night with no headlights.

# Apache Spark Docs

https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/web-ui.html

Apache Spark provides a suite of web user interfaces (UIs) that you can use to monitor the status and resource consumption of your Spark cluster.

Here’s your **Jobs Tab** section rewritten with icons for better readability:

---

## 📊 **Jobs Tab**

The **Jobs** tab provides two key views:

* **📋 Summary Page** – Shows high-level info like status, duration, progress of all jobs, and an overall event timeline.
* **🔍 Details Page** – Opens when you click a job, displaying the event timeline, DAG visualization, and all stages for that specific job.

---

### **📌 Information Displayed**

* 👤 **User** – Current Spark user
* ⏰ **Started At** – Startup time of the Spark application
* ⏳ **Total Uptime** – Time since the Spark application started
* 🗂 **Scheduling Mode** – Job scheduling strategy used
* 📈 **Number of Jobs (by Status)**:

  * 🟢 **Active**
  * ✅ **Completed**
  * 🔴 **Failed**

# Important Information

**CPU Cores (Hardware level)**

* These are physical or virtual cores on the machines in your cluster.
* Example: If a worker node has 2 CPUs √ó 8 cores each, that node has 16 CPU cores.
* This is the real hardware your jobs will run on.

**Spark Cores (Spark resource allocation)**

* In Spark, when we talk about ‚Äúnumber of cores‚Äù, we usually mean:
* How many CPU threads Spark is allowed to use across the cluster.
* This is controlled via executor cores (--executor-cores) √ó number of executors (--num-executors).
* Spark maps its ‚Äúcores‚Äù to CPU threads, but it‚Äôs a logical allocation, not a separate hardware entity.
* Spark can‚Äôt use more Spark cores than CPU cores available in the cluster (unless you overcommit in virtualized environments, which can hurt performance).

**Waves**

* In Spark, "waves" refers to how many rounds (batches) of tasks need to run sequentially to process all partitions of your dataset, given the number of available executor cores.
* Spark splits your data into partitions.
* Each partition is processed by one task.
* The number of tasks that can run at the same time is determined by your total available cores (sum of all executor cores).
* If you have more partitions than cores, not all tasks can run at once ‚Äî they‚Äôll have to be executed in waves.
* If you want 1 wave, your total cores should equal your total partitions (so all partitions run at once).
* If you‚Äôre okay with multiple waves, you can use fewer cores ‚Äî but total job time may increase.

# Thumb Rules

Here are some common **thumb rules** that Spark engineers (including me) usually assume when doing cluster configuration sizing:

---

## **üìå Partitioning**

1. **Default partition size:** \~**128 MB** per partition (sometimes 256 MB for large clusters to reduce task scheduling overhead).
2. **#Partitions formula:**

   $$
   \text{Partitions} = \frac{\text{Data size (MB)}}{\text{Partition size (MB)}}
   $$
3. Have **2‚Äì4√ó more partitions than total cores** for good load balancing.
4. Avoid too many small partitions ‚Äî increases task scheduling overhead.

---

## **üìå Cores per Executor**

5. Recommended: **4‚Äì5 cores per executor** for a good balance between parallelism and GC overhead.
6. Never exceed **\~5 cores** unless you know your workload is CPU-bound and GC is tuned well.

---

## **üìå Memory per Executor**

7. **Memory per executor formula:**

Partition size x Cores per executor x Safety factor (2‚Äì3√ó)

   * overhead (‚âà 300‚Äì500 MB).
8. Keep **executor memory ‚â§ 32 GB** to avoid Spark switching from ‚Äúcompressed oops‚Äù to normal object references (which use more memory).
9. **Heap + Overhead = Total executor memory** (YARN automatically adds overhead unless set manually).

---

## **üìå Total Cores**

10. **Cores = Executors √ó Cores per executor**.
11. **1 core processes 1 partition at a time** ‚Äî this is the key driver of waves.
12. For a **1-wave** execution:
* Total cores ‚âà Total partitions

For **multi-wave** execution:
* Total cores} ‚âà Partitions / waves

---

## **üìå Executor Count**

13. Executors = Total cores √∑ Cores per executor.
14. Keep a couple of cores free for the driver & application master (YARN mode).

---

## **üìå General**

15. **Data locality matters** ‚Äî having more cores than available local data blocks can cause network shuffling.
16. Always consider **compression factor** ‚Äî if data is compressed, memory needs post-decompression can be 2‚Äì4√ó higher.
17. Shuffle-heavy jobs (joins, groupBy) require more memory per executor.
18. If caching data, size executors so the dataset fits in memory with safety buffer.

---

# Scenario 1

To handle 50GB dataset in spark what are:
* a. Total number of cores and partitions?
* b. Total number of executors?
* c. Total memory required?

We‚Äôll assume:

* You‚Äôre running on **YARN/Standalone** with a moderate cluster.
* Your dataset size = **50 GB** (uncompressed; if compressed, memory needs can increase after decompression).
* Each executor core processes **1 partition at a time**.
* Partition size recommendation = **128 MB** (standard in Spark for parallelism and memory efficiency).
* Waves = 3
* Cores / Executor = 5

---

## **1. Total Number of Partitions**

Formula:

$$
\text{Number of partitions} = \frac{\text{Dataset size in MB}}{\text{Partition size in MB}}
$$

Dataset size in MB:

$$
50 \times 1024 = 51200\ \text{MB}
$$

Number of partitions:

$$
\frac{51200}{128} = 400
$$

‚úÖ **Total partitions = 400**

---

## **2. Total Number of Cores**

Rule: **1 core processes 1 partition at a time**. To maximize CPU usage without excessive context switching, keep cores ‚âà partitions / expected parallelism.

Let‚Äôs say each executor gets **5 cores** (common choice for balancing CPU and GC overhead).
If we want to process all partitions in ‚âà2‚Äì3 waves:

$$
\text{Cores needed} \approx \frac{\text{Total partitions}}{\text{Waves}}
$$

If waves = 3:

$$
\frac{400}{3} \approx 134\ \text{cores total}
$$

‚úÖ **\~130‚Äì140 cores total** (cluster-wide).

---

## **3. Total Number of Executors**

Formula:

$$
\text{Executors} = \frac{\text{Total cores}}{\text{Cores per executor}}
$$

If **5 cores/executor**:

$$
\frac{135}{5} = 27\ \text{executors}
$$

‚úÖ **\~27 executors**.

---

## **4. Memory per Executor**

Rule of thumb:

* Memory per executor ‚âà **(Partition size √ó Cores) √ó Safety factor**
* Safety factor: 2‚Äì3√ó (to handle shuffle, intermediate data, caching).

For **5 cores/executor**:
Raw data per executor wave:

$$
128 \text{MB} \times 5 = 640\ \text{MB}
$$

With **3√ó safety**:

$$
640 \times 3 \approx 1920\ \text{MB}
$$

Add overhead (‚âà 300‚Äì500 MB) ‚Üí **\~2.5 GB per executor**.

Round up for GC efficiency: **3 GB per executor**.

---

## **5. Total Memory Required**

$$
\text{Executors} \times \text{Memory per executor}
$$

$$
27 \times 3\ \text{GB} = 81\ \text{GB total cluster memory}
$$

---

### **Final Recommendation for 50 GB Dataset**

| Parameter                  | Value   |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Total partitions           | 400     |
| Total cores (cluster-wide) | \~135   |
| Executors                  | \~27    |
| Memory per executor        | 3 GB    |
| **Total memory**           | \~81 GB |

# Scenario 2
To handle 50GB dataset in spark what are:
* a. Total number of cores and partitions?
* b. Total number of executors?
* c. Total memory required?

We‚Äôll assume:

* You‚Äôre running on **YARN/Standalone** with a moderate cluster.
* Your dataset size = **50 GB** (uncompressed; if compressed, memory needs can increase after decompression).
* Each executor core processes **1 partition at a time**.
* Partition size recommendation = **128 MB** (standard in Spark for parallelism and memory efficiency).
* Waves = 1
* Cores / Executor = 5
  
## **1. Total Number of Partitions**

Same formula as before:

$$
\text{Number of partitions} = \frac{\text{Dataset size (MB)}}{\text{Partition size (MB)}}
$$

Dataset size in MB:

$$
50 \times 1024 = 51{,}200\ \text{MB}
$$

With **128 MB partitions**:

$$
\frac{51{,}200}{128} = 400\ \text{partitions}
$$

‚úÖ **Partitions = 400**

---

## **2. Total Number of Cores (1 wave)**

In **1 wave**, each partition gets its own core at the same time:

$$
\text{Total cores} = \text{Total partitions}
$$

$$
\text{Total cores} = 400
$$

‚úÖ **400 cores needed cluster-wide**

---

## **3. Total Number of Executors**

If we still stick with **5 cores/executor** (good for balancing CPU & GC load):

$$
\text{Executors} = \frac{400}{5} = 80
$$

‚úÖ **80 executors**

---

## **4. Memory per Executor**

Rule of thumb:
Memory per executor ‚âà **Partition size √ó Cores per executor √ó Safety factor**

* Partition size = 128 MB
* Cores/executor = 5
* Safety factor = 3 (to handle shuffle + caching + overhead)

$$
128 \times 5 = 640\ \text{MB (raw data)}
$$

$$
640 \times 3 = 1{,}920\ \text{MB}
$$

Add ‚âà 500 MB overhead ‚Üí \~2.4 GB

Round to **3 GB/executor**

---

## **5. Total Memory Required**

$$
\text{Executors} \times \text{Memory per executor}
$$

$$
80 \times 3\ \text{GB} = 240\ \text{GB total cluster memory}
$$

---

### **Final Setup (1 wave)**

| Parameter                | Value  |
| ------------------------ | ------ |
| Total partitions         | 400    |
| Total cores              | 400    |
| Executors                | 80     |
| Memory per executor      | 3 GB   |
| **Total cluster memory** | 240 GB |

---

üí° **Key Difference**

* **1 wave** ‚Üí All data processed simultaneously ‚Üí Needs **much more hardware** (400 cores & 240 GB memory).
* **Multiple waves (e.g., 3)** ‚Üí Less hardware at once but takes more time.

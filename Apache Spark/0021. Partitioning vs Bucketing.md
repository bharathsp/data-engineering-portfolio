## üîç Key Differences Between Partitioning and Bucketing

| Feature            | **Partitioning**                                                   | **Bucketing**                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Divides data into **directories** based on column values           | Divides data into **files** based on hash of column values     |
| **Granularity**    | Coarse-grained (folder level)                                      | Fine-grained (file level within a partition)                   |
| **How it works**   | Each distinct value of the partition column creates a subdirectory | Uses a hash function on column to distribute rows into buckets |
| **Example Column** | Good for low-cardinality columns (e.g., `country`, `year`)         | Good for high-cardinality columns (e.g., `user_id`, `email`)   |
| **Storage Layout** | `.../country=US/`, `.../country=IN/`                               | Files like `bucket_00001`, `bucket_00002`, ...                 |
| **Performance**    | Improves **partition pruning** and scanning                        | Optimizes **joins** and **sampling**                           |
| **Supported in**   | Spark, Hive, SQL                                                   | Hive (full support), Spark (limited support for bucketing)     |
| **Query Benefit**  | Reads only relevant partitions                                     | Efficient joins by aligning bucketed tables                    |
| **Control**        | Data layout is based on **column value**                           | Data layout is based on **hash value**                         |

## ‚úÖ When to Use What?

### üîπ Use **Partitioning** when:

* You have **columns with few distinct values** (e.g., 5‚Äì500).
* You want to **prune large datasets quickly**.
* Example:

  ```python
  df.write.partitionBy("country", "year").parquet("/data/sales")
  ```

### üîπ Use **Bucketing** when:

* You need **even distribution** of large data for joins.
* You deal with **high-cardinality columns**.
* Example (Hive SQL):

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (
      id INT,
      name STRING
  )
  CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 8 BUCKETS;
  ```

## üß† Real-World Analogy:

* **Partitioning** is like putting books in separate shelves by genre (e.g., Sci-Fi, History).
* **Bucketing** is like dividing each genre's books into smaller bins alphabetically.

# 🔧 **Spark Architecture Core Components**

## **1. Spark Driver**

The **Driver** in Apache Spark is like the **“Brain 🧠”** of a Spark application.
It runs the main function of your program and is responsible for coordinating the entire job execution.

### 📋 Roles & Responsibilities of Spark Driver

1. **Program Execution** 📝

   * Runs the **main()** method of your Spark application.
   * Defines RDDs, DataFrames, transformations, and actions.

2. **Cluster Communication** 🌐

   * Connects with the **Cluster Manager** (YARN, Mesos, or Standalone).
   * Requests resources for Executors.

3. **Task Scheduling** 📅

   * Breaks the job into **stages** and **tasks**.
   * Assigns these tasks to **executors**.

4. **Metadata Management** 📂

   * Keeps track of RDD lineage, DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), and execution plans.

5. **Result Collection** 📬

   * Collects results from executors.
   * Returns final output to the user or writes to storage.

### 💾 Driver Memory

* **Driver memory** = Memory allocated to the Driver process.
* Used for:

  * Storing metadata (RDD lineage, DAG).
  * Holding small results from executors.
  * Keeping variables and SparkSession context.
* Controlled by:

  ```
  --driver-memory 4g
  ```

  (This allocates 4 GB RAM to the driver).

⚠️ If driver memory is too small → job may fail with **OutOfMemoryError**.

### 🏎️ Real-life Analogy

Imagine **a race**:

* **Driver (Car Driver 🧑‍✈️)** = Spark Driver

  * Plans the route (DAG).
  * Decides pit stops (stages).
  * Communicates with team.
  * Monitors the race and ensures car (executors) is performing.

* **Car 🚗** = Cluster resources (executors).

* **Pit Crew 👨‍🔧** = Cluster Manager (allocates resources).

* **Fuel & Tires ⛽** = Data & Tasks.

If the **driver (brain)** doesn’t have enough **focus/energy (memory)**, the whole race collapses.

---

## **2. SparkSession**

* **SparkSession** is the **entry point** to any Spark application.
* Think of it as the **“Gateway 🚪”** to interact with Spark.
* It allows you to use **RDDs, DataFrames, Datasets, and SQL** all in one place.

👉 Introduced in **Spark 2.0** to unify `SQLContext`, `HiveContext`, and `SparkContext`.

### 📋 Roles & Responsibilities of SparkSession

1. **Application Entry Point** 🔑

   * Provides a single point to connect with Spark.

2. **Resource Manager** ⚙️

   * Manages the Spark context (driver + executors).
   * Handles configuration settings.

3. **DataFrame & Dataset API** 📊

   * Allows you to create DataFrames and Datasets.

4. **SQL Queries** 🗂️

   * Lets you run SQL queries on structured data using `.sql()`.

5. **Catalog Access** 📚

   * Keeps track of tables, databases, and temporary views.

### 🖥️ Example in Python (PySpark)

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("MyApp") \
    .config("spark.some.config.option", "config-value") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Example: Create DataFrame
data = [("Bharath", 28), ("Anu", 25)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Name", "Age"])

df.show()

# Example: SQL Query
df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM people WHERE Age > 26").show()
```

### 🏎️ Real-life Analogy

Think of Spark as a **big airport ✈️**:

* **SparkSession = Airport Terminal 🛫**

  * Main entry point to the airport.
  * Provides access to flights (RDDs, DataFrames, SQL).
  * Has gates to different services (SQL, Hive, Catalog).

* **Flights ✈️** = DataFrames / RDDs.

* **Air Traffic Control 🛰️** = Driver + Cluster Manager.

Without the **terminal (SparkSession)**, you cannot reach flights (Spark features).

---

## **3. SparkContext**

* **SparkContext** is the **entry point** to the **low-level Spark Core API**.
* It represents a **connection between your Spark application and the Spark cluster**.
* Before Spark 2.0, every application **had to create a SparkContext** to talk to the cluster.
* After Spark 2.0 → you usually use **SparkSession**, which internally creates a SparkContext for you.

### 📋 Roles & Responsibilities of SparkContext

1. **Cluster Connection** 🌐

   * Establishes connection with the cluster manager (YARN, Mesos, Standalone).

2. **Resource Allocation** ⚙️

   * Requests resources (executors, CPUs, memory) from the cluster manager.

3. **RDD Creation** 📊

   * Used to create **RDDs** (Resilient Distributed Datasets), the core data structure of Spark.

4. **Task Distribution** 📅

   * Sends tasks (jobs broken into stages) to executors.

5. **Job Monitoring** 📈

   * Monitors the execution of jobs, tracks progress, and handles failures.

### 🖥️ Example in Python (PySpark)

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext

# Create SparkContext
sc = SparkContext("local", "MyApp")

# Create RDD
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rdd = sc.parallelize(data)

# Perform operation
result = rdd.map(lambda x: x * 2).collect()
print(result)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

👉 In modern Spark, you usually do:

```python
sc = spark.sparkContext
```

because `SparkSession` manages it for you.

### 🏎️ Real-life Analogy

Think of Spark as a **railway network 🚆**:

* **SparkContext = Station Master 🚉**

  * Connects the station (application) to the railway network (cluster).
  * Assigns tracks (executors) for trains (tasks).
  * Ensures smooth operation of trains (job execution).

* **Trains 🚂** = Jobs & Tasks.

* **Passengers 👨‍👩‍👧** = Data (RDD elements).

* **Railway HQ 🏢** = Cluster Manager (allocates tracks/resources).

Without the **Station Master (SparkContext)**, the trains cannot run.

✨ In short:
**SparkContext = The “engine connector” that lets your Spark application talk to the cluster and work with RDDs.**
👉 After Spark 2.0, it’s wrapped inside **SparkSession**, so you don’t create it directly in most cases.

---

## **4. DAG Scheduler**

Great one 🚀 — the **DAG Scheduler** is an important piece in Spark’s internal execution flow. Let’s break it down step by step with icons, roles, and a real-life analogy.

### 🧩 What is DAG Scheduler?

* **DAG Scheduler** is the component in Spark that converts a **logical execution plan** into a **physical execution plan**.
* It **organizes jobs into stages**, and each stage into **tasks**.
* DAG stands for **Directed Acyclic Graph** → a flow of operations with no cycles.

👉 It sits between the **user code** and the **Task Scheduler**.

### 📋 Roles & Responsibilities of DAG Scheduler

1. **Job Division** 🗂️

   * Splits a Spark job into **stages** based on shuffle boundaries.

2. **Stage Creation** 📑

   * Creates **ResultStage** (for final actions like `collect()`) and **ShuffleMapStage** (for shuffle operations).

3. **Task Set Preparation** 📦

   * Breaks each stage into **tasks**, one task per partition.

4. **Task Submission** 🚚

   * Sends task sets to the **Task Scheduler**, which then distributes them to executors.

5. **Failure Handling** 🔄

   * If a stage fails, retries it (default 4 times).

### ⚙️ Example Flow

Suppose you run:

```python
rdd.map(lambda x: x+1).filter(lambda x: x>5).reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a+b).collect()
```

* `map` & `filter` → narrow transformations (can be in one stage).
* `reduceByKey` → shuffle needed → new stage.
* `collect` → triggers a **job**.

**DAG Scheduler** will:

* Break into **two stages** (before and after shuffle).
* Create tasks for each partition.
* Send tasks to **Task Scheduler → Executors**.

### 🏎️ Real-life Analogy

Think of a **food delivery system 🍔🚚**:

* **Customer Order (Action like collect)** = Job

* **DAG Scheduler** = **Restaurant Manager 👨‍🍳**

  * Splits the order into **stages**: cooking, packing, delivery.
  * Assigns tasks (cut veggies, cook patty, pack meal).
  * Makes sure tasks flow logically (cook before pack, pack before delivery).

* **Task Scheduler** = **Waiters/Delivery Dispatch 🚴**

  * Takes each task set and sends them to the right worker (executors).

Without the **manager (DAG Scheduler)**, the workflow would be chaotic.

✨ In short:
**DAG Scheduler = The planner 🧠 that converts your logical operations into a stage-wise execution plan and hands over tasks to the Task Scheduler.**

---

## **5. Task Scheduler**

* The **Task Scheduler** is the Spark component that takes **tasks prepared by the DAG Scheduler** and actually **schedules them on cluster executors** for execution.
* It works at a **lower level** than DAG Scheduler.
* It does **not understand stages, RDDs, or DAGs** → it only knows **tasks** and executors.

### 📋 Roles & Responsibilities of Task Scheduler

1. **Task Dispatching** 🚚

   * Takes **TaskSets** from DAG Scheduler and assigns tasks to executors.

2. **Resource Allocation** ⚙️

   * Chooses the best executor (based on data locality & availability).

3. **Execution Monitoring** 📡

   * Tracks task status (running, completed, failed).
   * Collects task results from executors.

4. **Retry & Failover** 🔄

   * If a task fails, reassigns it to another executor (up to 4 retries by default).

5. **Communication with Cluster Manager** 🌐

   * Works with YARN, Mesos, or Spark Standalone to launch executors.

### ⚙️ Example Flow

Suppose DAG Scheduler sends a **TaskSet** (say, 100 tasks for 100 partitions).

* **Task Scheduler**:

  * Chooses executors close to the data.
  * Assigns each task to an executor.
  * Collects results & informs DAG Scheduler.

### 🏎️ Real-life Analogy

Think of a **restaurant again 🍴**:

* **DAG Scheduler = Head Chef 👨‍🍳**

  * Breaks big order into tasks: cut veggies, cook rice, grill chicken.

* **Task Scheduler = Kitchen Dispatcher 👨‍🔧**

  * Assigns each task to the right cook.
  * Ensures no cook is idle and tasks are retried if a cook messes up.
  * Tracks completion and reports back to the chef.

So **Task Scheduler is like the dispatcher who makes sure each worker executes their piece of work properly.**

✨ In short:
**Task Scheduler = The dispatcher that actually sends tasks to executors, monitors execution, and retries on failure.**
👉 It doesn’t know about DAGs/stages — only tasks.

---

## **6. Cluster Manager**

Nice 👍 — let’s wrap the Spark execution flow with the **Cluster Manager**.

---

## 🧩 What is Cluster Manager?

* **Cluster Manager** is the **external service** that manages cluster resources (CPU, memory) across multiple machines.
* Spark doesn’t manage resources by itself → it asks the **Cluster Manager** to provide them.
* Executors (workers that run tasks) are launched by the Cluster Manager.

👉 Without a cluster manager, Spark can’t run in a distributed way.

### 📋 Roles & Responsibilities of Cluster Manager

1. **Resource Management** ⚙️

   * Allocates CPUs, memory, and nodes for Spark applications.

2. **Executor Management** 🧑‍💻

   * Starts and stops executors as requested by the Spark Driver.

3. **Multi-Application Support** 🗂️

   * Runs multiple applications on the same cluster and shares resources.

4. **Communication with Driver** 🌐

   * Reports back about available resources.
   * Executes commands given by Spark Driver.

### ⚙️ Types of Cluster Managers in Spark

1. **Standalone** 🖥️

   * Spark’s built-in simple cluster manager.

2. **YARN** 🧵 (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)

   * Hadoop ecosystem’s resource manager.
   * Common in big data pipelines.

3. **Mesos** 🐧

   * General-purpose cluster manager.

4. **Kubernetes** ☸️

   * Container-based cluster manager (modern choice).

### ⚙️ Example Flow (Simplified)

1. **Driver** asks Cluster Manager → “I need 5 executors with 4 cores each.”
2. **Cluster Manager** checks available resources.
3. **Cluster Manager** launches executors on worker nodes.
4. **Task Scheduler** assigns tasks to these executors.

### 🏎️ Real-life Analogy

Imagine a **ride-hailing service 🚖** (like Uber):

* **Cluster Manager = Dispatcher Office 🏢**

  * Keeps track of all drivers (resources).
  * Assigns a driver (executor) when a passenger (task) requests a ride.
  * Ensures multiple customers (applications) can be served.

* **Spark Driver = Customer App 📱** (requests a ride).

* **Executors = Taxi Drivers 🚕** (do the actual driving = task execution).

Without the **dispatcher office (Cluster Manager)**, cars (executors) cannot be coordinated properly.

✨ In short:
**Cluster Manager = The “resource allocator” that provides executors to Spark and manages resources across applications.**

---

## **7. Worker Nodes**

* **Worker Node = Machine (physical or VM) in the cluster** that actually executes the tasks assigned by the Spark Driver.
* Each worker runs **executors** (JVM processes) where the tasks execute.
* Workers are managed by the **Cluster Manager** (YARN, Kubernetes, Standalone, etc.).

👉 Without worker nodes, Spark cannot process any data — the driver just does planning, but workers do the heavy lifting.

### 📋 Roles & Responsibilities of Worker Nodes

1. **Run Executors** ⚙️

   * Launch executors as instructed by the Cluster Manager.

2. **Task Execution** 🧑‍💻

   * Execute tasks assigned by the Task Scheduler.
   * Perform computations (transformations, actions).

3. **Data Storage (optional)** 💾

   * Store cached data (RDD/DataFrame persist).
   * Sometimes co-located with HDFS or other storage.

4. **Communication** 🌐

   * Send results back to the Driver.
   * Communicate with other executors during shuffle operations.

### ⚙️ Example Flow

1. Driver → asks Cluster Manager for resources.
2. Cluster Manager → assigns Worker Nodes.
3. Worker Nodes → launch Executors.
4. Executors → run tasks on data partitions.

### 🏎️ Real-life Analogy

Imagine a **factory 🏭**:

* **Spark Driver = Factory Manager 👨‍💼** (plans what needs to be produced).
* **Cluster Manager = HR/Admin Dept 🗂️** (assigns workers to production lines).
* **Worker Nodes = Factory Workers 👷** (do the actual manufacturing).
* **Executors = Worker’s tools 🛠️** (machines they use to produce results).

Without the **workers (Worker Nodes)**, no actual product (data processing) happens.

✨ In short:
**Worker Nodes = The machines in the cluster that run executors to perform the actual computation and data storage in Spark.**

---

## **8. Executors**

* **Executors** are **JVM processes** launched on **Worker Nodes**.
* They are responsible for **executing tasks** and **storing data**.
* Executors live for the lifetime of a Spark application (unless dynamic allocation is enabled).

👉 Think of executors as **workers inside a worker node**.

### 📋 Roles & Responsibilities of Executors

1. **Task Execution** 🧑‍💻

   * Run the tasks assigned by the **Task Scheduler**.

2. **Data Storage** 💾

   * Hold in-memory data for RDD/DataFrame caching.
   * Store shuffle data for intermediate stages.

3. **Communication** 🌐

   * Report back the task status/results to the Driver.
   * Exchange data with other executors during shuffle.

### 💾 Executor Memory

* **Executor Memory** = Amount of memory allocated to each executor process.
* Used for:

  * **Storage memory** (caching RDDs/DataFrames).
  * **Execution memory** (sorting, shuffling, joins, aggregations).
  * **User memory** (custom objects, UDFs).

👉 Configured using:

```bash
--executor-memory 4g
```

(allocates 4 GB RAM per executor).

⚠️ If executor memory is too small → jobs may fail with **OutOfMemoryError**.

### ⚙️ Executor Cores

* **Executor Cores** = Number of **parallel tasks** an executor can run at the same time.
* Each task requires **1 core**.
* Example:

  * If an executor has **4 cores**, it can run **4 tasks simultaneously**.

👉 Configured using:

```bash
--executor-cores 4
```

⚖️ Rule of thumb: More cores → more parallelism, but each needs memory.

### 🏎️ Real-life Analogy

Think of a **restaurant kitchen 🍴**:

* **Worker Node = Kitchen 👨‍🍳**
* **Executor = Cook 👩‍🍳** (a worker in the kitchen).
* **Executor Memory = Ingredients & workspace 🥕🍳** each cook has for preparing dishes.
* **Executor Cores = Number of hands/utensils ✋🍴** the cook has → determines how many dishes they can prepare at once.

If the cook (executor) has **too little memory (ingredients)**, they’ll fail to complete the dish.
If they have **more cores (utensils)**, they can cook multiple dishes in parallel.

✨ In short:

* **Executors = JVM processes that do actual computation & caching**.
* **Executor Memory = RAM allocated to each executor**.
* **Executor Cores = Number of tasks each executor can run in parallel**.

## 🔁 **Spark Execution Cycle and Data Movement**

### **Data Movement**

* **Transformations (lazy) ⚡**

  * `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, etc. → only build lineage in **Driver Memory**.
  * No actual execution until an **Action** is called.

* **Actions (trigger execution) 🚦**

  * `collect()`, `count()`, `saveAsTextFile()` → send execution plan to Executors.
  * Executors run tasks, store intermediate data in **Executor Memory**.
  * Shuffle operations (e.g., `reduceByKey`, `groupBy`) → data moves between Executors across Worker Nodes.

* **Result Return 📨**

🔹 1. Results Returned to the Driver

Executors return results to the **Driver** when:

* The **Action** requires the **final output** to be available in the Driver process.
  Examples:
* `collect()` → Brings the **entire dataset** back to the Driver. ⚠️ Risky for large data (can cause OOM).
* `take(n)` → Brings the **first n rows** to the Driver.
* `count()` → Sends just a **number (aggregate)** back to Driver.
* `reduce()` → Sends the **final reduced value**.
* `first()` → Sends the **first element**.

📌 **Analogy**:
Imagine the Driver as a **manager in the office 🧑‍💼**. If they ask *“Give me the total sales number”*, the workers (executors) will compute and just **send back the number**. If the manager asks *“Bring me all sales invoices”* (`collect()`), the workers will **dump all papers on the manager’s desk** (dangerous if it’s millions of papers).

🔹 2. Results Stored in Executor Memory / Storage

Executors keep results **locally** in memory/disk when:

* The data is **cached** (`df.cache()` or `rdd.persist()`) → Stored in executor memory/disk for reuse.
* **Intermediate shuffle data** → During wide transformations (like `groupBy`, `join`), executors write shuffle files on disk and exchange data with other executors (not returned to driver).
* Iterative algorithms (like MLlib training) → Executors hold partitions in memory for repeated access.

📌 **Analogy**:
Executors are like **team members 🧑‍🔧**. If they know they will need some results again, they **keep copies of their work in their drawers (executor memory)** instead of giving everything to the manager (driver).

🔹 3. Results Stored in HDFS, S3, DB

Executors don’t normally send results back to the Driver when the end goal is writing output to a database. Instead, they write directly from Executors → Database, in parallel.

This happens in situations like:

* ➀ Saving Transformed Data into a Database
  * Example: df.write.jdbc(...) or df.write.format("jdbc").save()
  * Executors partition the data and each Executor writes its partition directly to the database table.
  * 📌 Use case: You clean and enrich customer data and then save results into a PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server database.
 
* ➁ Streaming Output to a Database
  * In Structured Streaming, Executors continuously process micro-batches.
  * For each batch, Executors directly push processed rows into a database sink.
  * Example: Writing streaming results to Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, or JDBC.
  * 📌 Use case: Real-time IoT sensor data → aggregated → stored in Cassandra.
 
* ➂ ETL Workflows
  * In ETL pipelines, Spark Executors read raw data, transform it, and write final curated data to OLTP/OLAP databases.
  * Executors handle the parallel writes, ensuring data is distributed evenly (or based on partitioning).
  * 📌 Use case: ETL from raw logs → Spark transformation → Store summary in Redshift/BigQuery.
 
* ➃ Batch Jobs that Persist Results
  * Jobs like daily aggregation, customer segmentation, or financial reports.
  * Executors compute partitions → directly insert/update database rows.
  * Driver never collects full results in memory (avoids OOM).
  * 📌 Use case: Banking transactions → daily rollups → written back to Oracle DB.

# 🔄 Data Flow (Simplified Path)

1. **User → Driver** 🧑‍💻: You write Spark code.
2. **Driver → Driver Memory** 🧠💾: Stores DAG (lineage, plan).
3. **Driver → DAG Scheduler → Task Scheduler** 📑🚚: Splits into stages & tasks.
4. **Task Scheduler → Cluster Manager** 🌐: Requests resources.
5. **Cluster Manager → Worker Node** 🏭: Launches Executors.
6. **Worker Node → Executor** 👷: Runs tasks.
7. **Executor → Executor Memory & Cores** 💾🔢: Stores partitions in memory, uses cores for parallelism.
8. **Executors ↔ Executors** 🔄: Shuffle data exchange (joins, reduce, groupBy).
9. **Executor → Driver** 📨: Sends results back (for actions like collect).

---

# 🏎️ Real-life Analogy

Imagine **online food delivery 🍔🚚**:

* **User** = You place an order (Spark code).
* **Driver (Restaurant Manager 👨‍🍳)** = Plans what needs to be cooked.
* **Driver Memory** = Recipe book 📖 (stores plan, lineage).
* **DAG Scheduler** = Splits into steps: chopping, cooking, packing.
* **Task Scheduler** = Assigns tasks to specific cooks.
* **Cluster Manager** = HR assigns workers and kitchens.
* **Worker Node (Kitchen 🏭)** = Place where cooking happens.
* **Executor (Cook 👩‍🍳)** = Cook who prepares dish.
* **Executor Memory (Ingredients & workspace 🍳)** = Storage for preparation.
* **Executor Cores (Hands/utensils ✋🍴)** = How many dishes a cook can make in parallel.
* **Shuffle (Passing ingredients between cooks)** = Sharing between executors.
* **Action (Deliver order)** = Food finally reaches you.

---

✨ In short:

* **Transformations** → build lineage in Driver Memory.
* **Actions** → trigger execution, tasks sent to Executors.
* **Executors** → process partitions using cores & memory.
* **Data** → moves between executors (shuffle) and back to Driver.

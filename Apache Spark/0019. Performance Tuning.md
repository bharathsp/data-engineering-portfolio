### ⚙️ What is **Apache Spark Performance Tuning**?

**Apache Spark Performance Tuning** refers to the process of **optimizing Spark jobs** to improve their **execution speed, resource utilization, and scalability** by fine-tuning configurations, choosing the right transformations/actions, and managing memory, parallelism, and shuffling.

Tuning becomes essential when:

* Jobs are slow or resource-hungry.
* You’re processing large-scale datasets.
* You need to scale applications across clusters efficiently.

## 🔑 Key Areas of Performance Tuning in Spark

| Area                       | Description                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory Management**      | Configuring executor memory, avoiding OOM errors.        |
| **Partitioning Strategy**  | Choosing right number of partitions for parallelism.     |
| **Shuffling Optimization** | Reducing data shuffle with joins and groupBy operations. |
| **Caching/Persisting**     | Storing intermediate results to avoid recomputation.     |
| **Broadcasting**           | Broadcasting small datasets to reduce join cost.         |
| **Parallelism Settings**   | Adjusting `spark.default.parallelism`, cores, and tasks. |
| **Garbage Collection**     | Tuning GC behavior for long-running jobs.                |

## 🚀 Common Spark Configs to Tune

```python
conf = SparkConf()
conf.set("spark.executor.memory", "4g")
conf.set("spark.executor.cores", "4")
conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "100")
conf.set("spark.default.parallelism", "100")
conf.set("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", 10 * 1024 * 1024)  # 10 MB
```

## 🧪 Example 1: Caching for Reuse

### Without Caching:

```python
df = spark.read.csv("big_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Expensive operation repeated
df_filtered = df.filter("region = 'US'")
print(df_filtered.count())
print(df_filtered.select("sales").sum())
```

> ❌ Recomputed twice — slow.

---

### With Caching:

```python
df = spark.read.csv("big_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

df_filtered = df.filter("region = 'US'").cache()
df_filtered.count()
df_filtered.select("sales").sum()
```

> ✅ First computation triggers execution and stores in memory. Second is faster.

---

## 🧪 Example 2: Broadcast Join Optimization

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast

big_df = spark.read.parquet("sales_data")
small_df = spark.read.csv("country_lookup.csv", header=True)

# Optimized broadcast join
result = big_df.join(broadcast(small_df), "country_code")
```

> ✅ Reduces shuffle by broadcasting small table to all workers.

---

## 🧪 Example 3: Repartitioning to Improve Parallelism

### Problem: Uneven or large partitions slow down job

```python
df = spark.read.csv("huge.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
print(df.rdd.getNumPartitions())  # Might show few large partitions
```

### Solution:

```python
df = df.repartition(100)  # Increase parallelism
```

> ✅ Enables better distribution and parallelism across executors.

---

## 🧪 Example 4: Reducing Shuffle in `groupBy`

### Expensive:

```python
df.groupBy("product_id").count()  # Triggers shuffle
```

### Better:

```python
df = df.repartition("product_id")  # Pre-partitioning to reduce shuffle
df.groupBy("product_id").count()
```

## 📈 Summary of Tuning Best Practices

| Tip                               | Why it Helps                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Use `.cache()` or `.persist()`    | Avoid recomputation of reused data           |
| Use `broadcast()` for small joins | Avoid shuffle on big table                   |
| Optimize number of partitions     | Improve parallelism and task execution speed |
| Avoid `groupByKey()`              | Use `reduceByKey()` to reduce shuffle        |
| Tune executor memory & cores      | Prevent OOM and improve compute throughput   |
| Set shuffle partitions wisely     | Avoid too many or too few partitions         |

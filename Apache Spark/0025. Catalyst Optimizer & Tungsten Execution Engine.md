## üîπ Catalyst Optimizer

### üìå What is it?

Catalyst is **Spark SQL‚Äôs query optimization framework** that transforms SQL and DataFrame operations into optimized execution plans.

### üí° Key Features:

1. **Tree-based optimization**: Represents queries as **abstract syntax trees (ASTs)** and applies transformations.
2. **Rule-based and cost-based optimizations**:

   * **Rule-based**: Constant folding, predicate pushdown, etc.
   * **Cost-based**: Joins reordering based on stats (row size, data distribution).
3. **Logical to physical plan**:

   * Parses the query ‚Üí Builds a **logical plan** ‚Üí Optimizes it ‚Üí Generates an **optimized physical plan**.
4. **Pluggable and extensible**: Easy to add custom rules or optimization logic.

### üß† Example:

```python
df.filter("age > 30").select("name")
```

Catalyst transforms this through various stages:

* Unresolved Logical Plan ‚Üí Analyzed Logical Plan ‚Üí Optimized Logical Plan ‚Üí Physical Plan ‚Üí Executed

## üîπ Tungsten Execution Engine

### üìå What is it?

Tungsten is a **memory and code optimization engine** introduced to enhance Spark‚Äôs performance by going ‚Äúclose to the metal‚Äù.

### üîß Key Goals:

1. **Memory management**: Uses **off-heap** memory to reduce GC overhead.
2. **Cache-aware computation**: Optimizes data layout to improve CPU cache usage.
3. **Whole-stage code generation (WSCG)**: Dynamically generates Java bytecode to execute entire query stages without virtual function calls or interpretation overhead.
4. **Binary format**: Stores data in **compact binary format** for efficient CPU processing.

### üöÄ Benefits:

* Less GC pauses
* Faster execution
* Reduced memory footprint
* Lower CPU usage

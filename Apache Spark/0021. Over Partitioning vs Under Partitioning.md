# 📌 Partitioning in Spark

* A **partition** = a logical chunk of data processed by one Spark task.
* More partitions → more parallelism (but also overhead).
* Fewer partitions → less parallelism (but larger tasks).

# ⚠️ Under-Partitioning (Too Few Partitions)

👉 When the **number of partitions is too small** compared to available resources.

### 🔎 Issues:

* 🐢 **Poor parallelism** → Not all executors/cores are used.
* ⏳ **Stragglers** → Some tasks process huge chunks of data while others sit idle.
* 🧠 **Memory pressure** → A single partition may not fit in executor memory, leading to OOM errors.

### 📊 Example:

Suppose you have a **1 TB dataset** and only **2 partitions**:

```
Partition 1: 500 GB
Partition 2: 500 GB
```

* Only 2 tasks will run, even if you have 100 cores.
* Each task has to process 500 GB → **OOM risk** and **slow job**.

# ⚠️ Over-Partitioning (Too Many Partitions)

👉 When the **number of partitions is too high** compared to workload.

### 🔎 Issues:

* 🐌 **Task scheduling overhead** → Spark has to schedule too many tiny tasks.
* 💸 **Shuffle overhead** → More partitions = more shuffle files → higher disk & network I/O.
* ⚡ **Small file problem** → If writing results, may produce millions of tiny files in storage (S3/HDFS).

### 📊 Example:

Suppose you have a **1 GB dataset** and **10,000 partitions**:

```
Each partition ≈ 100 KB
```

* 10,000 tasks need to be scheduled, but each does very little work.
* Overhead of scheduling > actual processing time.
* If writing to S3 → 10,000 small files (inefficient for downstream systems).

# ⚖️ Finding the Balance

✅ A good rule of thumb:

* **Partition size** ~ 128 MB – 256 MB for HDFS/S3 workloads.
* **Number of partitions** ≥ `2 × number of cores in cluster`.

👉 Use:

* `df.repartition(n)` for increasing partitions (balanced shuffle).
* `df.coalesce(n)` for reducing partitions (no shuffle, just merges).

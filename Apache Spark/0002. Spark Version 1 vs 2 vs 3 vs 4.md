# üîç Spark 1.x

| Feature / State    | Details                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Timeframe          | Early years of Spark (2014‚Äì2016).                                                                                                                                                 |
| Major Architecture | RDD-based API (Resilient Distributed Datasets), no stable DataFrame / Dataset API in early versions.                                                                              |
| SQL / DataFrames   | Spark SQL was introduced in later Spark 1.x (around 1.3+), but DataFrame API was experimental, not stable.                                                                        |
| Streaming          | Spark Streaming (micro-batch) present. But simpler, limited features.                                                                                                             |
| ML / Libraries     | Early versions of MLlib, graph processing (GraphX), but less mature.                                                                                                              |
| Limitations        | Less optimized for large-scale SQL, Python/PySpark functionality limited, poorer performance vs later versions. Fewer optimizations (no AQE, no dynamic partition pruning, etc.). |

Spark 1.x laid the foundation: distributed processing, RDDs, basic streaming, SQL interface beginnings. But for serious production use, limitations in performance, usability, and feature set pushed people to Spark 2.x.

# üöÄ Spark 2.x

| Feature / Improvements      | Details                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DataFrame & Dataset         | DataFrame API matured; Dataset API introduced (typed, with schema) to combine type safety + performance.                               |
| SQL API Improvement         | More SQL support; better integration with DataFrame API.                                                                               |
| Performance improvements    | Better catalyst optimizer, better execution, built-in file format support (Parquet, ORC) etc.                                          |
| Streaming Improvements      | Structured Streaming introduced (Spark 2.0) which provides a higher-level API vs older DStreams. Micro-batch model but more stable.    |
| Python / UDFs               | Support for Python UDFs in DataFrames, more stable PySpark, although performance often worse than Scala.                               |
| External Deployment Options | Spark on Kubernetes becomes possible; more flexibility in deployment.                                                                  |
| Limitations                 | Still no production-ready adaptive query execution (some experiments in later 2.x), less mature support for semi-structured data, etc. |

Spark 2.x was about reaching maturity: better APIs, more stable SQL/streaming, more file format support, pushing performance up, better developer usability.

# ‚ö° Spark 3.x

| Added Features & Improvements          | Why It Was Big / What Changed                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)         | Dynamically changing query plans at runtime based on data statistics ‚Äî e.g. re-optimizing joins, handling data skew better. Makes SQL queries much more efficient. ([Databricks][1]) |
| ANSI SQL Compliance Options            | More strict SQL semantics (error on invalid casts vs silent nulls etc.), making Spark SQL behave closer to standard SQL. In 3.x these could be enabled. ([Databricks][1])            |
| Better Python / Pandas Integration     | Pandas UDFs improved; more API coverage; better error messages; type hints etc. ([Databricks][1])                                                                                    |
| Structured Streaming Enhancements      | More triggers, better state management, etc. ([adaltas.com][2])                                                                                                                      |
| File format / Data source improvements | More push-downs, better Parquet/ORC readers, better partition pruning. ([Restack][3])                                                                                                |
| Cleaner APIs & Deprecations            | Removal of older APIs, cleaner semantics, more stability.                                                                                                                            |

In short: Spark 3.x was about performance, scalability, better streaming, better SQL compatibility, and better multi-language support.

# üî≠ Spark 4.x

Spark 4.0 is the newest major version (as of 2025) and brings some major leaps. Some of the big changes:

| Feature / What‚Äôs New                                     | Details                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spark Connect production readiness & enhancements        | Spark Connect (client-server decoupled driver) becomes more stable, better API coverage, more languages, easier to use. ([Apache Spark][4])                                                     |
| SQL language features & compliance                       | ANSI SQL mode is default; new data type: `VARIANT` for semi-structured data; session variables; pipe syntax; SQL UDFs & UDTFs; string collation. ([Apache Spark][4])                            |
| Streaming & State enhancements                           | New arbitrary stateful processing API v2, ability to query streaming state via data source, etc. Better observability. ([Databricks][5])                                                        |
| Performance, developer experience, language improvements | Faster PySpark clients (very lightweight), extended/connect clients for non-JVM languages, improved Python UDF / table function performance, better integration across languages. ([Medium][6]) |
| New Data Types, better semi-structured data support      | As said: `VARIANT`, better JSON/XML data source, easier semi-structured queries. ([Databricks Community][7])                                                                                    |

Spark 4.x is pushing both in expressiveness (SQL features, developer ergonomics) and in performance / architecture (Spark Connect, better client-server model, modern runtimes).

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations / Migration Challenges

* Breaking changes: moving from Spark 2 ‚Üí 3 or 3 ‚Üí 4 may expose bugs in existing queries (especially if you rely on non-ANSI behavior or custom UDFs).
* UDF compatibility & performance: older UDFs often perform worse or need rewrites.
* APIs deprecated: some functions removed or replaced.
* Resource tuning changes: new settings (for AQE, for Spark Connect etc.) need tuning.

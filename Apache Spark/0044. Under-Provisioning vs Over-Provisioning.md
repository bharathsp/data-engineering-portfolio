# 📌 Driver memory & Executor memory

* **Driver memory** 🧠: Used by the Spark driver to hold metadata, DAG, task scheduling info, and collected results (`collect()`, `count()`, etc.).
* **Executor memory** ⚙️: Used by Spark executors to store **data**, perform **shuffles**, **caching**, and run transformations.

# ⚠️ Under-Provisioning

👉 Allocating **too little memory** for driver or executors.

### 🔎 Driver Memory Issues:

* ❌ Driver OOM (OutOfMemoryError).
* ❌ Job fails if `collect()` or `show()` is run on large datasets (since driver tries to pull all data).
* ❌ Metadata and DAG information may exceed driver heap.

**Example:**
Driver has **1 GB memory**, but you try `df.collect()` on a 10 GB dataset → driver crashes.

---

### 🔎 Executor Memory Issues:

* ❌ Executors cannot fit partitions in memory → **disk spill** during shuffle.
* ❌ More **GC (Garbage Collection)** overhead.
* ❌ Tasks fail with `OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`.

**Example:**
Executor has **2 GB memory**, but a shuffle task needs 4 GB for a join → task retries/fails.

# ⚠️ Over-Provisioning

👉 Allocating **too much memory** for driver or executors.

### 🔎 Driver Memory Issues:

* ❌ Wasted resources → driver doesn’t need 64 GB just to manage metadata.
* ❌ Longer JVM garbage collection pauses due to a huge heap.
* ❌ Cluster resources underutilized (driver hogs memory that executors could use).

**Example:**
Driver set with **32 GB** but workload only needs **2 GB** → memory wasted, GC overhead increases.

---

### 🔎 Executor Memory Issues:

* ❌ Giving executors too much memory reduces the **number of executors** you can run (less parallelism).
* ❌ More memory per executor = fewer executors = cluster cores sit idle.
* ❌ Large heaps cause long GC pauses.

**Example:**
Cluster has **128 GB total memory**.

* If you allocate **64 GB per executor**, you only get 2 executors.
* If you allocate **8 GB per executor**, you can run 16 executors → much better parallelism.

# ⚖️ Balance (Best Practices)

✅ **Driver**

* Allocate enough for metadata + results.
* Rule of thumb: **4–8 GB** for driver (unless using `collect()` on big data, which is discouraged).

✅ **Executors**

* Better to have **more smaller executors** than a few large ones.
* Sweet spot: **4–8 GB per executor** with **~5 cores each**.
* Ensure executor memory ≈ (DataSize ÷ Parallelism).

* **Under-Provisioning** ❌

  * [🚗 Driver: 🧠 Small] → Crashes on `collect()`
  * [⚙️ Executor: 🧠 Small] → Disk spill / OOM

* **Over-Provisioning** ❌

  * [🚗 Driver: 🧠 Huge] → Wasted memory + GC delays
  * [⚙️ Executor: 🧠 Huge] → Fewer executors, less parallelism

* **Balanced Provisioning** ✅

  * [🚗 Driver: 🧠 Moderate] → Stable job execution
  * [⚙️ Executors: ⚡ Balanced Memory + Parallelism] → Efficient performance
